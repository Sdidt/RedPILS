bbc grilling bjp spokesperson on censoring tweets criticizing the govt on covid ,you didn t misunderstand this is sadly the viewpoint of the indian government today and to some extent this is how our governments always have been people appeal cases like these all the way to the supreme court and the supreme court does end up overruling the government and rebuking it for violating article freedom of speech of our constitution but by the time justice is served it s often months later and the temporary bans have already done their job successfully like over the last one year these are the reasons and justifications i ve heard from spokespersons of the government for clamping down on social media fake news even when it s not offending the sensibilities of religion x almost any minor criticism even legitimate of religious practices be it muslim or hindu is often met with hostility inciting violence at this point even someone saying we should flood the streets of delhi and protest would end up getting booked under our it act for inciting violence whether or not they get convicted aside the very fact that you can initially get arrested is a huge chilling effect on free speech one incident that really stands out is the case of disha ravi farmers in india were protesting a new law and as a part of the protest disha along with a couple others were making a shared google doc with common talking points template tweets and hashtags users could share and some press releases the government of india arrested her on charges of sedition because the toolkit was used by foreign actors to influence domestic agenda to incite violence who were these foreign actors celebrities like greta thunberg and rihanna at this point i kinda feel sad about how anti nationalist is commonly thrown around as a term for anyone who criticises the government maybe i m going the other extreme but the only day i ll accept india is really free is the day someone could burn an indian flag in new delhi and not be charged legally as a criminal for burning it unless they violate fire codes or their burning it harms other people there or if they do it with an illegal accelerant extreme i know but the whole you re antinational and you can be arrested if you do x is a very slippery slope we started out there people who burn flags support enemy states like pakistan should be jailed and slowly we ve devolved to this if only we could go back ,/r/india/comments/n07ph4/bbc_grilling_bjp_spokesperson_on_censoring_tweets/gw62pih/,-1.0,1.0

former diplomat k c singh ponders the internal matter conundrum of the indian government,i completely agree with you on the time scales and the need to rope in more people questioning wrong when you see it is both simple and trivial but the very fact that so many people are afraid to do even that gives a lot of power to the ruling party if you want to see change start with something simple if one person alone does it it s easy to suppress if thousands do it together it s harder you cannot get people to stand up when they are so scared that they won t even speak their mind i am trying to get others to raise their voice against what they see as wrong so that as i am doing it i am not alone and i am not alone cause there are many others who are very vocal about all that they see as wrong that is why i say that india isn t beyond repair everyone has to raise their voices and that tipping point will come sooner take a look at the bihar election that was not fought on communal lines i take that as a huge plus ,/r/india/comments/kp0drv/former_diplomat_k_c_singh_ponders_the_internal/ghyb344/,0.0,0.0

kejriwal at it s best ,see the problem is not whether firecrackers are a part of diwali since ancient times or not the problem is that we have to constantly change the way we celebrate our festivals we have to change our way of expressing ourselves but the rivers of blood that flow during goat sacrifices for islam is a completely acceptable way of expression using the same firecrackers during new year s is an acceptable form of expression however during diwali it becomes unacceptable why why should our ways of celebration change whilst they pollute our streets with blood once a year we will pollute as we wish if they pollute our land with violence and blood ,/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/x7xtwl/kejriwal_at_its_best/infxu7s/,0.0,0.33

congress and ayodhya,ok i stand corrected i didn t know about the league of militant atheists thanks for pointing that out and i completely forgot about the enver hoxha regime as far as i know most communist regimes in history have treated religion as a matter of convenience following the bolshevik revolution the ussr tried to stick to classical marxism advocating focus on internationalism rather than patriotism but when the soviets were reeling under the shock of operation barbarossa stalin invoked russian patriotism and a significant role in that was played by the russian orthodox church which was then granted various privileges china has been actually meddling in tibetan buddhism installing their own panchen lama as a counterweight to the dalai lama vietnam has also always had a strong buddhist ethos but even if such an extremist atheist leader were to emerge in india would he gain any traction militant hindus yogi sadhvi and militant muslims owaisi brothers though asaduddin is trying to put forth a softer image have succeeded but a militant atheist like the examples you stated would never succeed in electoral politics ,/r/india/comments/i424wk/congress_and_ayodhya/g0jajyx/,0.0,0.66

the indian government may call whatsapp to explain why its new data privacy policy applies in india but not in europe,unlike in th european union which has passed several privacy regulation laws we have laws that are really bad and can be exploited easily you must have hard of gdpr right it specifically focuses on personal data protection you can go and research on these laws in detail what the indian government has proposed is that they re asking an alcohol shop to give them sugarcane juice we never made any laws to begin with then how is whatsapp liabile here they have the fredom to exploit because the current laws does not recognise that as a crime let me give you an example suppose you made an account in an indian site or even an international site that knows about this flaw you request them to delete every data that is available about you and then close the account but the customer service denies because who exactly is going to question that this has happened with me i requested to delete my nptel account but they never did it i requested coding ninjas to do the same they never removed it completely simply because customer service improvement it seems just think why delete information if you have it and nobody is stopping you to do so tl dr simply putting in privacy laws don t work there needs to be regulations ,/r/india/comments/kx23sk/the_indian_government_may_call_whatsapp_to/gj8l551/,0.0,0.0

you guys noticing what s happening in sri lanka ,the easter bombing had created a massive rise of sinhalese buddhist nationalism the people chosed rajapaksa the strong man supreme leader who could save the buddhist from the muslims and hindus tamils in srilanka rajapaksa clan took over srilanka and they demolished the economy in the name of national security they declared massive tax cut for the corporates which torpadoed the government finance however the government expenditure is increased a lot because of a lot of freebies and some big projects like that useless port and the new megacity project etc to finance all these they printed a lot of money and took a lot of loan they cancelled low interest japanese and imf loans but took chinese loans with higher interest because it was easier to swindle the pandemic hit hard srilankan tourism sector a big source of foreign currency the government did a demonization of chemical fertilizers to make srilankan agriculture organic that stupid decision massively hurt the agriculture due to that the lankan government was forced to import a lot of food grains which cost them a lot of foreign currency too the agriculture problem also resulted in less production of tea and coffee two biggest export items of srilanka they also pegged the lankan rupee to usd which was also a big blunder the combination of all these snow balled into the current economic crisis of srilanka ,/r/india/comments/tt1ryh/you_guys_noticing_whats_happening_in_sri_lanka/i2vfbef/,0.0,0.0
an attempt to address the list of simplified explanation that is floating around in an attempt to justify the citizenship amendment fact,i m still a little bit skeptical still on the fence about this whole issue and want additional clarification what is the extraordinary proof that will be required and how will it be different from the proof that non muslim non migrants will require if you are not in the special case covered by the caa you ll be subject to rest of the citizenship act which lays out four principal ways through which indian citizenship can be acquired birth descent registration and naturalization wouldn t a lot of people be eligible at least to acquire citizenship by naturalization as far as i know the act applies to every person irrespective of their religion only the caa lays out a special condition for non muslim migrants from three countries that of a reduced time five years to be eligible for naturalization the purpose of the nrc would be to make sure that everybody tagged as an indian citizen has the documented proofs that establishes at least one of the four principal requirements under the act namely birth descent registration and naturalization for example one of the proofs would be something that can establish that you have been a resident of india for years so that you re eligible for citizenship by naturalization my understanding is that it s not that hard to demonstrate that you have been resident in india for twelve years for most people it might be hard for the homeless but wouldn t that be a problem for everybody including non muslims who aren t migrants because the caa only applies to non muslims who are also migrants from those three countries and have been a resident of india since at least december and even if you don t have documented proof there are other provisions such as witnesses or local proofs supported by members of the community as clarified by the mha spokesperson yesterday i think that people might be confusing the assam nrc process for the one that will be implemented nationwide the assam nrc guidelines were laid out by the supreme court in specifically for assam and as of today no official guideline or process or procedure exists for the nationwide nrc exercise so i m not sure if it s right to be jumping to conclusions if we don t even know what the nationwide nrc exercise will look like ,/r/india/comments/ebdeup/an_attempt_to_address_the_list_of_simplified/fbhx8gp/,0.0,0.0

 judges can t decide bjp mp s strong objection on same sex marriages,you aren t wrong to say that hinduism is technically not a religion but a way of life and that some of the problematic practices we have now were corrupted by those in power since hinduism is a way of life i consider culture lifestyle rituals and dharma as hinduism not just the dharma that is because unlike abrahamic religions we do not have an absolute text but guidelines so all these factors constitute the religion and that is also the basis for my comment regardless of what original intention may have been the practices had at some point intertwined with hinduism these faults existed long before mughals and british came in it was exploitable and exploited before others exploited it with time we slowly separated right from wrong and will continue to do so but not all of these problems were planted by outsiders given that our society had been practicing them for centuries before anyone came in we share responsibility but atleast hinduism or rather the practitioners knew what was right and what was wrong to just stop practicing yes this is also what i was saying in my previous comment when i said hinduism has progressed with time and with time we will overcome what shortcomings we have but people didn t just stop practicing they applied the dharma with their times and slowly removed the bad components we need to do the same but a common problem i see is people assuming hinduism to perfect and needing no change some just blame each and every single problem in hinduism to the mughals and the british people need to accept that there were faults that we as a society had ourselves before anyone exacerbated it only after accepting can we change ,/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/zpre2v/2_judges_cant_decide_bjp_mps_strong_objection_on/j0wzfni/,2.0,0.83

unpopular opinion your views on hijab are immaterial to what s happening to the girls in karnataka,i ll copy paste a comment i made elsewhere on this thread about someone equating saris to burqas similar reasoning applies to your point it s why i specifically mentioned controlling their entire bodies in an extremely explicit and dominant manner i e total ownership how many women in india hindu and muslim and every other religion eagerly look forward to buying saris how many of them set aside some savings each year for saris how many muslim women would choose to wear a sari if given the option how many women in the west wear saris when they attend indian functions now how many hindu women in india would choose to wear a burqa if given the option pray tell how many women eagerly look forward to their yearly burqa purchase the reason they are different is because the burqa is an apparent and absolute symbol of dehumanisation the only part of you visible to the world is your eyes maybe your face the rest is monochrome and hidden it is so far beyond any patriarchal vestige you associate to saris and that is evident if you try to answer my questions above truthfully it says it all that people outside indian culture are far more likely to wear saris gleefully and post pictures everywhere than wear burqas gleefully and post pictures everywhere of course no one should be forced to wear saris but i d wager a lot of people would wear them with no forcing necessary can t say the same for burqas ,/r/india/comments/so2gtj/unpopular_opinion_your_views_on_hijab_are/hw7uedu/,0.0,0.5

i ve collected all available records of upa censoring free speech congress made requests day to facebook and requests day to google that is when of the country didn t even have access to the internet ,there is a bit of problem in such situations tbh in case of private companies censor you have the ambit of law and the state to help when the state decides to censure you then you don t have much recourse just because a government was elected doesn t mean that people who voted for them agree with all their actions democracy is not just elections in the present case big tech actions ofc may be wrong in many cases their power doesn t even match up to the power of the state which decide the policy and legal structure of a country take an example you choose to give away your privacy to the state which may be similar to how an individual using facebook decides to use it while trading his personal info while you have made a choice on your own to trust state more than companies remember many of us didn t we don t want the dilution of privacy this is different as to tech companies in which if i don t agree with their privacy policy i can leave because if i don t agree with indian government policy then i can t do anything because every tech platform here will follow the government policy the founders may have political preference and they might not change easily but their platform doesn t equate to it zuckerberg views dont matter much on how a user uses whatsapp what you are concerned about is editorial actions of platforms of censoring or removing which is why i say reform safeharbor provisions which provides such protection to platfroms even they are doing editorial actions current action is using hammer when a knife was needed court orders are needed but such orders can easily be provided even for investigation phase before and if the situation went to a trial moreover court order isn t needed much as a competent authority as per law can also ask for user identity by law the competent authority is the home secretary which basically means the home ministry or the union government so checks and balances are not even in consideration here,/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/nn035c/ive_collected_all_available_records_of_upa/gzsd47s/,0.0,0.0

smriti irani s son recently graduated from a foreign university however not a single media house named the university ,i don t think the agniveer policy is targeted at youth of middle upper middle and upper class income groups at all so imo that is a completely wrong argument to make here i actually think the agniveer policy is targeted more towards providing much needed temporary employment to the lower income group youth who end up getting degrees from random colleges dont get jobs cos they lack any real skill and end up spending money on this useless degree agniveer policy gives them much needed income a lifelong set of skills and an excellent corpus upon their completion of years which can be used to start a solid small business atmanirbharta where it is actually needed it does not and should not concern the population in india the narrative of asking people to stay in india is driven by the fact that people spend loads and loads of money to settle abroad and do low skill jobs there instead of creating jobs here when they have the money to do so as for the hypocrisy for sending her son out seems like a convenient assumption that it was solely her decision to send him out what if he was adamant to go if you yourself could afford it why wouldnt you do it i agree with you on some level that policy makers should lead by example but i think this reaction is completely unjustified this is just my opinion not looking for hate i am also apolitical only bumped into this post through random scrolling happy to discuss and possibly change my mind ,/r/india/comments/w7co36/smriti_iranis_son_recently_graduated_from_a/ihmihr5/,0.0,0.0

cm kejriwal has a genius idea to boost the nation s economy,for one thing he s wrong when he considered gandhi a politician par excellence to quote gandhi believed that politics had to be guided by religion which treats all beings as equal and removes excessive greed from life to many today deeply sucked into comfort seeking lifestyles gandhi may look impractical and too na ve for the complicated modern world but no one not even his worst enemies would deny that he was a simple soul yet a gritty one who became a powerful weapon to make colonialism history i try to be one of the few people who don t want to see gandhi as a politician or a mahatma to quote guha gandhi is impossible to classify in terms of conventional political categories was he a socialist conservative liberal or all of these he was a true original the left came to a belated recognition of the moral greatness of gandhi especially because of what he did for hindu muslim harmony for a long time the left claimed that non violence was a devious way to wean the masses away from the revolutionary path but its attitude changed after what gandhi did in for communal harmony the right essentially dislikes gandhi it is profoundly ambivalent about him but instrumentally knows it cannot reject him outright so it tries to make him more of a hindu assimilate him into a line of hindu saints but anyone on social media would know the hindu right detests gandhi and also for the genocide thing gandhi was with the khilafat movement and when the genocide happened he termed the moplaphs as misguided and ignorant not because of any political leanings but because in greek philosophy namely socrates all good is knowledge and all evil is ignorant the same goes with the concept of maya in advaita vedanta,/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/ydqq7s/cm_kejriwal_has_a_genius_idea_to_boost_the/itx572c/,-1.0,0.0

an attempt to address the list of simplified explanation that is floating around in an attempt to justify the citizenship amendment fact,a very short explanation would be that caa gives opportunities based on religious beliefs which makes it unconstitutional even when you look at it without nrc caa promotes the formation of a religion state which immediately makes it non secular i think the right question to ask would be the reason behind not adding muslims in the caa since even some sections of muslim communities also experiences persecution and if you assume that muslims aren t facing any problems in these countries then adding muslims in caa shouldn t make a big difference to the number of people applying for citizenship therefore muslims should be provided with the same opportunity too to maintain the secular nature of our country ,/r/india/comments/ebdeup/an_attempt_to_address_the_list_of_simplified/fbbg90d/,-2.0,0.0

 payal mehta violence caught on cctv said to be attack on a bjp workers home in kasba, which are totally law and order problems and have nothing to do with religion intolerance in a country where madarsas brainwash children to hate idol worshipping polytheistic pagans koran and other similar verses and government funds these religious institutions secularism in a country where non muslims cannot manage mosques and non christians can t manage churches but for hindus our temples do not belong to us in most of the states governments have passed acts and legislations to take over hindu institutions including temples mutts and endowments this has enabled the government to interfere in the temples management practices and rituals not just that temples properties and income have also been usurped by the government the most outrageous fact is that the government exerts such a control exclusively on the hindu temples the places of worship of other religions enjoy freedom and autonomy this is a clear cut case of systematic discrimination and harassment from education to ecology and culture to charity hindu temples have played a pivotal role in shaping the indian society today s india has become a battleground for the clash of civilizations and the hindu society is facing an existential threat the need to revive the temple eco system is more important than ever but this cannot be achieved without freeing them from the clutches of the state the government s control over the hindu temples is unconstitutional and immoral hindu temples belong to the hindu society and the state must exit immediately while the state governments control over lakh out of an estimated lakh temples across the country there is no such control over muslim and christian religious bodies in this backdrop there are demands to amend the hindu religious and charitable endowments hrce act which allows the state governments to take over temples and maintain complete control over them and their properties there are over state governments which control only hindu religious institutions specifically temples right from the appointment of administrators to mandatory collection of service charge this takes away the community s right and resources to protect its interests this according to them is discriminatory as only hindu community suffers this kind of treatment it violates the concept of secularism also the indian constitution does not permit the state to run religious institutions those advocating for equality say that the process of taking control of temple riches was started by the mughals and was followed by the british rulers after independence the jawaharlal nehru government continued with the policy of controlling the temples by enacting the hrce act in to the contrary there is no such control over mosques and churches we demand that in the same way temples should also be freed from any kind of control the government must amend the act which is the root cause of the problem said j sai deepak noted supreme court lawyer he also pointed out that traditionally also the raja king does not have the right over the wealth of the temple how could indian courts recognise sharia based muslim personal law while claiming to be secular how could central and state governments take over the management of hindu temples if they were secular how could a secular government provide financial assistance to educational institutions run by religious organisations how could a secular government codify and modify hindu personal law how would the government extend the existing caste based reservations to minority religions if it were secular ,/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/n3fvao/payal_mehta_violence_caught_on_cctv_said_to_be/gwqvmer/,1.0,0.0

smriti irani s son recently graduated from a foreign university however not a single media house named the university ,mostly because we massively overload them while underfunding them delhi university has an undergrad intake of tens of thousands of students master s intakes of hundreds meanwhile there have been no permanent faculty hires in years so now a majority of the lecturing is being done by ad hocs and guest lecturers who are basically phds and early career scholars who cannot grow in their fields because there is no job security and shit pay and why is that because we neither support our unis nor give them autonomy they have regularly faced budget cuts even as the government makes them take more and mroe students usually with each reservation reform because the brand value and demand for higher education is high so they bow down to public pressure and arbitrarily increase seats meanwhile everyone wants to get in and nobody likes being left out so the application sizes are enormous and the government rather than trusting them to select for themselves imposes arbitrary central exams usually poorly designed and with shit primary education too many students getting in don t have basic skills so the colleges also need to focus on improving their language and reasoning abilities fact is we re simply asking too much of them and just not paying them enough du should honestly be half a dozen university instead of the super organization that it is incapable of functioning effectively because of its massive size and we just need more universities there are more good universities in a single us state than there are in the entirety of india unfortunately that requires the government to do something it hates give more money give autonomy help the institutions build up but stop imposing insane bureaucratic rules on them that destroy research capacity instead for the last decades we ve done the opposite fixing it would be a generational effort not gonna happen in a few years and i m not sure if we as a people have any sort of patience for it we also need to fix our primary education but that s not my primary area so i don t have as much specific info for that ,/r/india/comments/w7co36/smriti_iranis_son_recently_graduated_from_a/ihjmlyi/,0.0,0.83

today i learned that congress ammended the constitution in to have reservation for anglo indians in loksabha seats and kept on extending it from when the law expired in modi govt abolished it instead of extending it ,here s how the convo went me if someone identifies as nazi they must not live in germany or any nation which supports the right of jewish people to breathe be alive you they are mixed and not nazi they would never have lived with jews if they were nazi me well nazi have routinely spoken about racial purity so they will have kicked these mixed persons out hence they did not go with nazi and remained with the jewish people you they are mixed and not nazi you see what s happening here just replace nazi with the other invader with whom certain persons identify by prefixing the race of the invader ahead of indian and replace jews with tribals natives of bharath you said that x will have gone to britian if they were british and not stay back in india i showed that the brits of that time were openly racist put up boards saying and dogs not allowed thus these mixed persons such as x will have faced abuse if they even tried to go to britian and you are back saying x are not gora they are not british if there is no differentiating factors then there is absolutely no reason to add the prefix on the word indian is there the fact that these persons choose to voluntarily identify themselves with said prefix means they claim ancestral roots with the abuser with the invader again going back to nazi scenario even if a person knows that generations ago some of their ancestors worked for the nazi ss some were jewish today that mixed race person will not proudly add nazi as a prefix to german if anything they will feel ashamed of that historical horror ,/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/11g18n6/today_i_learned_that_congress_ammended_the/jaqw4qi/,1.0,0.83

you guys noticing what s happening in sri lanka ,firstly i am not saying it the great communist magazine the atlantic is saying it but i am guessing you didn t even read it before commenting so here the sections which i felt are relevant in case you feel i am quoting it out of context or other such things go ahead read it from the link the prime example of this is the sri lankan port of hambantota as the story goes beijing pushed sri lanka into borrowing money from chinese banks to pay for the project which had no prospect of commercial success onerous terms and feeble revenues eventually pushed sri lanka into default at which point beijing demanded the port as collateral forcing the sri lankan government to surrender control to a chinese firm our research shows that chinese banks are willing to restructure the terms of existing loans and have never actually seized an asset from any country much less the port of hambantota a chinese company s acquisition of a majority stake in the port was a cautionary tale but it s not the one we ve often heard it was the canadian international development agency not china that financed canada s leading engineering and construction firm snc lavalin to carry out a feasibility study for the port we reviewed a second feasibility report produced in by the danish engineering firm ramboll that made similar recommendations to the plans put forward by snc lavalin arguing that an initial phase of the project should allow for the transport of non containerized cargo oil cars grain to start bringing in revenue before expanding the port to be able to handle the traffic and storage of traditional containers armed with the ramboll report sri lanka s government approached the united states and india both countries said no but a chinese construction firm china harbor group had learned about colombo s hopes and lobbied hard for the project china eximbank agreed to fund it and china harbor won the contract this was in six years before xi jinping introduced the belt and road initiative sri lanka was still in the last and bloodiest phase of its long civil war and the world was on the verge of a financial crisis there is a bunch of detail in the atlantic article about how it was financed and sri lanka chose the worst deal for itself for a conflict torn country that struggled to generate tax revenue the terms of the loan seemed reasonable some more details when sirisena took office sri lanka owed more to japan the world bank and the asian development bank than to china of the billion in debt service sri lanka would pay in only percent was because of hambantota the central bank governors under both rajapaksa and sirisena do not agree on much but they both told us that hambantota and chinese finance in general was not the source of the country s financial distress there was also never a default colombo arranged a bailout from the international monetary fund and decided to raise much needed dollars by leasing out the underperforming hambantota port to an experienced company just as the canadians had recommended sri lanka chose china merchants making it the majority shareholder with a year lease and used the billion cash infusion to bolster its foreign reserves not to pay off china eximbank the uganda international airport has been debunked already here is another communist article written by maoist whose nation is extremely friendly to china again i am quoting the part which i feel is relevant but if you feel i am quoting it out of context go ahead and read the article details published in a report in the daily monitor newspaper stated that uganda allegedly had to surrender one of its national asset the entebbe international airport to china s exim bank for defaulting on its loan repayments in the aftermath of this development ugandan authorities have been consistently insisting on three issues the grace period is yet to expire and that the ugandan government is confident of not defaulting on any obligations on repayment that the terms of the loans are semi concessional in nature and in line with uganda s infrastructure financing programme most of these claims are truthful there is also a bloomberg article on it focusing on africa ,/r/india/comments/tt1ryh/you_guys_noticing_whats_happening_in_sri_lanka/i2yi29f/,0.0,0.0

unpopular opinion your views on hijab are immaterial to what s happening to the girls in karnataka,it s not that they are mutually exclusive but that the current socio religious narrative is so much more critical of muslims than any other religion and typically the dismissal of criticisms from people not of a particular minority community stem from the person from a majority not being able to understand the experiences and daily struggles of the minority community it s easy for us to sit here and talk about how oppressive the hijab is or isn t but ultimately it s impacts can only be truly understood my muslim women as a hindu you do not face the kind of discrimination or hostility that muslims have to face and so your opinion is at best an unempathetic take from an outsider sure anyone can criticize anyone else but so too are people free to decide the weight and legitimacy of your criticism based on your identity and life experiences your approach is so close to men telling women to not wear short clothes for their own safety you can still do it but you can t act surprised if people call you out for it ,/r/india/comments/so2gtj/unpopular_opinion_your_views_on_hijab_are/hw7lux0/,-2.0,0.66

an attempt to address the list of simplified explanation that is floating around in an attempt to justify the citizenship amendment fact, i know i ll get a lot of flak for this as this seems to be a left leaning thread majorly and there seems to be little space for any open minded arguments still i ll voice my opinions the above statement of yours sounds more like hypocracy because the home minister has said many things he has also said indian muslims need not worry and there will be nothing against this you are making your whole argument on verbal statements of a politician rather on what s written just because it supports what you already believe in you are free to do that also my only problem with such speculations is people are losing lives due to such false fear mongering which is sad and no one is bothered to give a shit on that fact as far as the bill is concerned the only people who are going to be affected by this bill are bangladeshi musilm refugees and rohingya muslim refugees as this bill is intended towards removing or filtering them if the protests are for their inclusion then it s valid and i take back all that i ve said there is no single agenda of the protestors and neither anyone knows what should be the solution which sounds more like a resistance to change rather than a protest they are creating new issues of police violence as nobody s clear on what really they want assam protests of no ilegal immigrants is different and kindly exclude them from this argument all this kinda things happen only when you don t have an agenda but started opposing something without any base and now your new issue is the alleged violence amidst the chaos and people are not bothered what the realy issue is please don t start now with if you combine nrc with this ,/r/india/comments/ebdeup/an_attempt_to_address_the_list_of_simplified/fb752x7/,2.0,0.66

an attempt to address the list of simplified explanation that is floating around in an attempt to justify the citizenship amendment fact,the apprehension about a nation wide nrc is only misplaced but not entirely false the very fact that you have to prove ancestry is kind of unnecessary at this juncture also the other important thing one has to focus on is that the words religious persecution doesn t feature in the amendment rather the proviso says x y z communities as exempted by the govt in rules or orders made under foreigners act and passport act so your apprehension is misplaced not entirely false the reason being that the criteria of religious persecution appears merely on the order of mha in exempting those minorities to get extended visas under the said acts that order can be changed at any time without the parliament s assent meaning that the criteria can also be changed say economic persecution or likewise so when the criteria changes the people who will be getting citizenship will entirely be in the hands of the executive which is pretty scary because non muslims have the blanket protection under caa which says they are exempted by orders under the said acts foreigners and passport acts but it doesn t mention criteria of religious persecution in the caa itself this is what people should be educated about my concern is most people i talked to on either sides donno much and even though it is necessary for everyone to deliberate upon such a sensitive and pressing issue it is sad that people don t do their research before that this only reduces this debate to merely being a war between ideologies and political parties but not about how this caa nrc is utterly insufficient and unnecessary provided links below please read and then make informed opinion does religious persecution appear in caa caa suffers from excessive delegation p s i know iam contradicting myself but i found out about this after i posted the comment sad people who were vehemently opposing the bill didn t seem to know about this and the effect it has but i also agree the apprehension about the nation wide nrc and the possible impact it can have on muslims living in india who cannot produce documents under nrc is very much reasonable ,/r/india/comments/ebdeup/an_attempt_to_address_the_list_of_simplified/fbeeigk/,0.0,0.0

how can educated indians be so uneducated ,oh i see your confusion you re equating basic human understanding with education you will be forgiven because any normal person would think the same but that s the problem education doesn t necessarily mean instilling one with ethics and empathy it just means learning maths and science attending school and learning to empathize with others don t ho hand in hand now there people stupid enough that even after learning some basic things about human history they are stubborn enough to not let go of some prejudices that they may have picked up somewhere down the road and i repeat once again that going to school or having a degree still won t change some people from behaving like an empty toolbox that they are an interesting theory if education means people being nice and respectful then by the sheer amount of people who have certain education in india we should look more like the nice canadian folks even better ,/r/india/comments/iek8ca/how_can_educated_indians_be_so_uneducated/g2ko22b/,0.0,0.0
