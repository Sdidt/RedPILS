BJP Gujarat 2022 Manifesto.,"There are two types of parties those that promise a 1 T GDP, and those that promise a 1 T subsidy bill. Although some of these promises are kinda over the top UCC won't happen, neither will Olympics , almost all of them are based on creating economic activity, improving law order, and public goods like health and education.

Modi's 2014 campaign was on development agendas with hindutva background. A lot of left and centre people voted Modi. 2019 was completely different. Highly polarised towards the left and BJP managed to mobilize the right and moderates towards them while the left remained in the background.

The picture pretty much sums up the ideology of BJP right now,"The 1.9 million denied citizenship in Assam alone include native Assamese, relatives of an ex president, and soldiers who fought for this country for decades. How dare you deny then their rights for your entertainment? 1.4 million of those will be given citizenship and kept in Assam under CAA. So your stated propose of making space isn't really getting served. What is happening however is the increased struggle and watte of resources for serving the fascist agenda.

"""2 Judges Can't Decide"" BJP MP's Strong Objection On Same Sex Marriages","You either lack critical thinking, have no idea what you are talking about, or you are feeding right into the far right conpiracies of western bigots and Trump supporters. You know, the same people who think that white is a superior race and refuse to get vaccinated. I from east and west and way too many eastern countries let western far right propaganda influence their thinking and empathy. There isnt a single person I know of in the west that genuinely thinks pedophiles belong to the lgbt community. There is also nobody in the lgbt community that thinks that pedophilia is ok. Allowing trans people to pee in the bathroom that matches the gender on their IDs also has nothing to do with pedophilia. The people however accusing trans women of this have indeed a long history of their men sneaking into women's bathrooms and commit assault republican politicians, look it up . You also dont seem to realize that it is the other way around Trans women get frequently assaulted by others in the bathroom simply for existing no matter which bathroom they use, but the women's one is much safer for them . Do you care about that or are there some innocent humans that u think are not deserving of basic safety when peeing? There are entire statistics about it that u can look up. But u dont care about that, do you? I go with you lack critical thinking. You cant be eating up white nationalism conpiracies as an Indian unless u are a troll spreading misinformation In that case how do you still look at yourself in the mirror ? Hate is a nasty way to live life. You know it and I know it. PS As a former Christian, I gladly tell you which group is known to engange in pedophilia in the west The church religion. These are not only well known facts, but there are studies and statistics behind it. And it surely isnt just a western phenomenon.

I've collected all available records of UPA censoring free speech. Congress made 18 requests day to Facebook and 15 requests day to Google. That is when 70 of the country didn't even have access to the internet.,"First of all that is not what I said it is one thing to criticize the current government's policies, it is quite another to claim that the country had more freedoms prior to the current government coming to power. The entire narrative of the opposition has been that ""freedom"", ""democracy"", ""secularity"", were part of the old India and not the new India, which is entirely false, and needs to be called out as false. Asking Twitter to appoint an officer within India is quite a normal request Twitter has no problem appointing officers in the US who have gone so far as to ban an American president, and many of his supporters nor does it have any problem adhering to European or Australian laws and empowering individuals working for Twitter in those countries to take such decisions. It is only India where they demand all requests from the government be sent to the US, as if they are not capable of hiring Indians to make such decisions. It is perfectly reasonable for the government to tell Twitter they need to assign local officers to deal with incoming requests. None of the other companies have an issue with this. Google agreed. Facebook agreed. I mean who wouldn't, this is a perfectly reasonable request. And no, it was not about dissent. It was about people spreading vaccine fearmongering, and people coordinating riots such as the one on republic day, using social media. The government has no problem with you guys posting things like ""modi is useless chaiwala"", ""chowkidar chor hai"", ""surgical strikes were a jumla"", etc, on social media. The only reason Twitter was able to create so much drama out of this situation is thanks to individuals such as yourself, and the parties you guys support. In your brain, when you see that the Modi government have a disagreement with a foreign social media company, you view it as an opportunity to attack the government regardless of the merits of the situation. Twitter knows it has useful idiots like yourself on its side, who might even go out onto the streets to protest on their behalf, which is why it can behave as if Indian laws don't apply to it.",gzuc1qu,/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/nn035c/ive_collected_all_available_records_of_upa/gzuc1qu/,0.5

May 16th Shame on Govt for sending vaccines abroad . June 1st Shame on Govt for not sending vaccines abroad . Is this a joke? Dirty politicising of the Pandemic by the Congress perfectly captured by 3 Shashi Tharoor tweets.,"Let's be logical. India's first batch of vaccines was ordered in January. The number of doses Mere 15 million. To let you know we have a population of 1 billion. Hence, more than 2 billion doses are required. Poonawalla never thought he would require a billion doses. What's implicit here? You're smart enough hopefully to infer that. The second batch was ordered as late as 28 April. You do realize that the second wave was raging at this time? Yes, and it was anticipated. Almost no country has managed to escape the wrath of successive waves! By comparison, many countries even by PPP standard have invested tons of cash in R D whereas SII and BB, and others were left at their own mercies. Not to mention we have NOT imported a SINGLE vax . The US by comparison has hoarded 300 million doses of AZ even after having more than sufficient stock to inoculated its citizens multiple times. Other countries are capable of inoculating their citizens MULTIPLE times. India was, indeed, capable. Someone's mismanagement DOESN'T make my country any less capable. So, Modi need not have to snap to make billions of doses come out of his ass. Citation https https P.S. As I said, neither I deal with whataboutism nor with ad hominem attacks.

How the Pakistani Lobby in the US West has infiltrated and influenced academic and historical studies of India and Hinduism,"The dream of the Muslim homeland had had strange consequences. And strangest of all was this the state that had appeared to some as God itself, a complete earthly reward for the faithful, lived not so much by its agricultural exports or by the proceeds of its minor, secondary industries, as by the export of its people. The newspaper advertisements called it manpower export. The business was organized. Like accountants studying tax laws, the manpower export experts of Pakistan studied the world's immigration laws and competitively gambled with their emigrant battalions visitor's visas overstayable here most European countries , dependents shippable there England , student's visas convertible there Canada and the United States , political asylum to be asked for there Austria and West Berlin , still no visas needed here, just below the Arctic Circle Finland . They went by the planeload. Karachi airport was equipped for this emigrant traffic. Some got through some were turned back. Abroad, the emigrants threw themselves on the mercies of civil liberties organizations. They sought the protection of the laws of the countries where the planes had brought them. They or their representatives spoke correct words about the difference between poor countries and rich, South and North. They spoke of the crime of racial discrimination and the brotherhood of man. They appealed to the ideals of the alien civilizations whose virtue they denied at home. From Among the Believers An Islamic Journey by V S Naipaul. The Pakistanis are more numerous, and have been far longer in the West. Besides which, the Pakistani government spends a lot of money on such lobbyist groups. If we want to fight this we have to do the same. And going by the fact that we are far larger we can do it on a much bigger scale.

Yes muslims would feel like they are second class citizens and this is where it's wrong. But the mass hysteria about all muslim immigrants being deported isn't true. Only affects those muslim immigrants who have lived in india for more than 5 and less than 11 years. For rest they are being treated like Hindus are treated. The real monster is the NRC. I can't imagine this being implemented properly without poor people being crushed further. That's what you need to fight.

However in every country there's some basis of division that politicians use like racial division in USA .In India it is cast as well as religion which is somewhat unfortunate cause it surely creates a divided society. But most importantly it is the economical development of a country that shapes the society. So India if develops well, then education will spread too and then less chance of Pakistan like fanaticism.

Unpopular Opinion Your views on Hijab are immaterial to what's happening to the girls in Karnataka,"It's not that they are mutually exclusive, but that the current socio religious narrative is so much more critical of muslims than any other religion.

It's easy for us to sit here and talk about how oppressive the hijab is or isn't, but ultimately it's impacts can only be truly understood my muslim women. As a hindu you do not face the kind of discrimination or hostility that muslims have to face and so your opinion is at best an unempathetic take from an outsider. Sure anyone can criticize anyone else, but so too are people free to decide the weight and legitimacy of your criticism based on your identity and life experiences.

"An attempt to address the list of ""simplified"" explanation that is floating around in an attempt to justify the Citizenship Amendment Fact","I'm still a little bit skeptical, still on the fence, about this whole issue and want additional clarification What is the extraordinary proof that will be required and how will it be different from the proof that non Muslim non migrants will require? If you are not in the special case covered by the CAA, you'll be subject to rest of The Citizenship Act, 1955, which lays out four principal ways through which Indian citizenship can be acquired Birth, Descent, Registration and Naturalization . Wouldn't a lot of people be eligible at least to acquire citizenship by naturalization? As far as I know, the 1955 act applies to every person irrespective of their religion. Only the CAA lays out a special condition for non muslim migrants from three countries, that of a reduced time five years to be eligible for naturalization. The purpose of the NRC would be to make sure that everybody tagged as an Indian citizen has the documented proofs that establishes at least one of the four principal requirements under the 1955 act, namely Birth, Descent, Registration and Naturalization. For example, one of the proofs would be something that can establish that you have been a resident of India for 12 years, so that you're eligible for citizenship by naturalization. My understanding is that it's not that hard to demonstrate that you have been resident in India for twelve years for most people. It might be hard for the homeless but wouldn't that be a problem for everybody? Including non muslims who aren't migrants? Because the CAA only applies to non muslims who are also migrants from those three countries and have been a resident of India since at least 31 December 2014. And even if you don't have documented proof there are other provisions such as witnesses or local proofs supported by members of the community, as clarified by the MHA Spokesperson yesterday . I think that people might be confusing the Assam NRC process for the one that will be implemented nationwide. The Assam NRC guidelines were laid out by the Supreme Court in 2015 specifically for Assam and as of today no official guideline, or process or procedure exists for the nationwide NRC exercise. So I'm not sure if it's right to be jumping to conclusions if we don't even know what the nationwide NRC exercise will look like.",fbhx8gp,/r/india/comments/ebdeup/an_attempt_to_address_the_list_of_simplified/fbhx8gp/,0.0

When Indira Gandhi cracked down on BBC,"How can someone actually in their right frame of mind equate Indira regime's emergency to a mere banning of a propaganda laden documentary. During Indira's emergency along with taking away press freedom there was a crackdown on trade unions as well. The Indira government reportedly banned trade union activity, strikes by workers and imposed fixed wages with no scope for bonuses. The workers that protested against this faced strict repression. Another controversial aspect of this period was Sanjay Gandhi's mass sterilization program across the country and demolitions of slums for beautification' of cities with little to no prior notice to slum dwellers. The most jarring aspect of Indira's emergency was Constitutional rights of people of India were suspended. Right to approach court for enforcement of Fundamental rights was taken away. Several of Gandhi's political opponents were imprisoned including LK Advani, Atal Bihar Vajpayee, Morarji Desai and JP Narayan. A mass sterilisation programme was also enacted by Sanjay Gandhi. All powers were vested in the hands of the Union government. This all went on for 21 months. When BJP and Modi remind people of dark days of emergency, it's the culmination of all these draconian acts which took place when emergency was declared. Modi ever since 2014 has never suspended your right to approach the Supreme Court or a High Court for enforcement of your fundamental rights. There has been no curtailment of press freedom. Malicious channels like NDTV, Quint, The Wire have regularly peddled propaganda and post Adani takeover sepoys like Rubbish who are on payroll of Congress have flocked to Youtube. IT dept has statutory right to conduct raids. They don't have to wait for the cover of emergency to conduct raids on suspicious bodies. These BBC are habitual offenders in tax evasion. Acc to a 2012 report, thousands of public employees, including those at the BBC, were not paying their taxes at the source. Report was by public accounts committee in the United Kingdom UK . In 2016, HM Revenue and Customs had reportedly begun an investigation into more than 100 BBC broadcasters amid allegations that they had underpaid their income tax and National Insurance contributions.

I grew up studying in Tirunelveli which has 20 Christian population. I don't need a twitter handle to tell me what's going on in the places I grew up. 1. Conversion is rampant here amongst the Dalit community, but that is more so of a political social movement that these pastors. Many Dalits claim they have converted to Christianity, remain Hindu on paper and even retain hindu practises like worshipping the local goddess. 2. Next method of conversion conversion for hospital school college discounts promise of job is also very common. No one converts for free food, the offer has to be quite worthy. This is operated through Christian hospitals schools social service business. 3 Amongst the manipulative methods, the prayer method is common. Here the pastors do not perform public healing, but go in search of patients and tell them to pray to jesus to see if he hears their prayers. Remember, normal treatment is NOT discontinued here. Patients are in fact, strongly encouraged to continue their treatment. As with serious medical cases, 20 30 of people do heal. When these people heal, these people approach the family and say Jesus has heard your prayers, so now convert if you have an inch of gratitude towards Jesus.

Unpopular Opinion Your views on Hijab are immaterial to what's happening to the girls in Karnataka,"I'll copy paste a comment I made elsewhere on this thread, about someone equating saris to burqas. Similar reasoning applies to your point it's why I specifically mentioned controlling their entire bodies in an extremely explicit and dominant manner i.e. total ownership . How many women in India, Hindu and Muslim, and every other religion, eagerly look forward to buying saris? How many of them set aside some savings each year for saris? How many Muslim women would choose to wear a sari if given the option? How many women in the West wear saris when they attend Indian functions? Now, how many Hindu women in India would choose to wear a burqa if given the option? Pray tell. How many women eagerly look forward to their yearly burqa purchase? The reason they are different is because the burqa is an apparent and absolute symbol of dehumanisation. The only part of you visible to the world is your eyes, maybe your face, the rest is monochrome and hidden. It is so far beyond any patriarchal vestige you associate to saris, and that is evident if you try to answer my questions above truthfully. It says it all that people outside Indian culture are far more likely to wear saris gleefully and post pictures everywhere, than wear burqas gleefully and post pictures everywhere. Of course no one should be forced to wear saris. But I'd wager a lot of people would wear them with no forcing necessary.

Here is the full picture. The person who is butchering the animal has to be male and Muslim means one less job opportunity for non muslim. If this is not discrimination, what is? How is it different from you saying I will not employ any Muslim in my office? Some islamic prayer forgot what has to be recited before cutting. This was just related to the meat aspect. Here is the kicker. There is a halal certification which Islamic agencies give to products. One of those islamic agency is Jamiat Ulima i Hind. It charges Rs 20,000 for registration of an Indian company and Rs 500 for each product GST charges are extra . Then there is renewal fee of Rs 15,000 as the registration is valid only for one year. now what does Jamait do with this money? Jamiat to give legal aid to 2 al Qaeda suspects' held in Uttar Pradesh File plea against Ayodha and many more.. Now you understand why they have a strong support from the community? Because they are not paying for it. You and I are..

My language and logical skills are fine enough to respond to your petty comments. I've a thousand things to do apart from being a spokesperson unlike you so forgive me if my comment was all over the place. Anyway, let's come to the point. I'll ignore a couple of comments you made above because they're full of shit. You think if you didn't intervene into Kashmir, it would have become Syria or some other extremist state. You're an idiot, I'll just say that and move on. Now, you accusing me of of being a Pakistani parrot, see that's the problem with you people. The moment someone speaks the truth, you just label them Gaddar, Pakistani, or terrorists or something else that feeds your justification of what's happening in Kashmir. Again I'll say, Kashmir was never a part of India. It was a princely state, the king made a pact with Nehru about Indias intervention into Kashmir to fight Pakistan incursion but it was never followed by india in terms of plebiscite. Every kashmiri today hates Indian occupation. They're the people who had been living there and it's their right to decide who they want in the form of government. That's called democracy which we don't see much under Modi government btw. Whatever you know, you learned it from Indian sources and that's not necessarily true all the time. No country would put something in their textbooks or acknowledge publicly their wrongdoings. For example, text books in Pakistan doesn't mention about Kargil and their defeat. Similarly, Indian text books will never show the true MAP of india, that's right the map you see is not true. India claims entire Kashmir as it's part but some park it POK and Akashi China which is not ours. Google it or look a world map by UN. P.S. I don't think you know the history very well my friend. If you knew, you wouldn't be arguing here. As a note, I would highly suggest that you visit Kashmir and see how Indian army treats all the civilians.

Rise of hatred in Kerala travel blogger and family receives death threats and cyber bullying from radical Islam for visiting Ram temple in Ayodhya,"Where are you getting these bullshit facts. It wasn't a revered temple nor is it the birthplace of Ram. It's not Kedarnath, it's not Vaishnodevi , it's not Dwarka or anything. It was a Small Ram temple in Ayodhya that was destroyed. Modern Ayodhya isn't even the same as the Ayodhya in which Ram was born, the locations are different. Yes Babur destroyed the temple and another temple mosque was built on the same land but then this mosque was burned down by people and then the Supreme court further granted the land back to the people who had a hand in burning down the Mosque essentially. How would this be fair to Muslims wouldn't you be outraged if something like this happened to a temple. Suppose there's a 300 year old Hanuman temple and people randomly started claiming this is where Muhammed was born and there was a mosque here and then proceeded to burn the temple and then rebuild a huge grand mosque there. What would be your reaction? Besides if someone is actually a Hindu by the book you're supposed to find Har Shan me Bhagwan. The ultimate ideal of Hinduism isn't found in a temple, it's within ourselves.

"An attempt to address the list of ""simplified"" explanation that is floating around in an attempt to justify the Citizenship Amendment Fact","The apprehension about a nation wide NRC is only misplaced but not entirely false. The very fact that you have to prove ancestry is kind of unnecessary at this juncture. Also, the other important thing one has to focus on is that the words ""religious persecution"" doesn't feature in the amendment. Rather the proviso says x,y,z communities as exempted by the govt. in rules or orders made under foreigners act and passport act. So your apprehension is misplaced. Not entirely false. The reason being that the criteria of religious persecution appears merely on the order of MHA in 2015 exempting those minorities to get extended visas. Under the said acts. That order can be changed at any time. Without the parliament's assent. Meaning that the criteria can also be changed. Say economic persecution. Or likewise. So when the criteria changes, the people who will be getting citizenship will entirely be in the hands of the executive. Which is pretty scary because non Muslims have the blanket protection under CAA which says they are exempted by orders under the said acts foreigners and passport acts but it doesn't mention criteria of religious persecution in the CAA itself. This is what people should be educated about. My concern is most people I talked to on either sides donno much. And even though it is necessary for everyone to deliberate upon such a sensitive and pressing issue, it is sad that people don't do their research before that. This only reduces this debate to merely being a war between ideologies and political parties but not about how this CAA NRC is utterly insufficient and unnecessary. PROVIDED LINKS BELOW PLEASE READ AND THEN MAKE INFORMED OPINION. Does religious persecution appear in CAA? CAA suffers from excessive delegation P.S I know IAM contradicting myself . But I found out about this after I posted the comment. Sad people who were vehemently opposing the bill didn't seem to know about this. And the effect it has. But I also agree the apprehension about the nation wide NRC and the possible impact it can have on Muslims living in India who cannot produce documents under NRC is very much reasonable.",fbeeigk,/r/india/comments/ebdeup/an_attempt_to_address_the_list_of_simplified/fbeeigk/,0.25

Everything is going exactly as planned to blame Diwali for pollution.,"I never said Diwali is as large a problem as other pollution sources. But it is easiest to control.

This has nothing to do with what we are discussing. You are now bringing tangential issues to the discussion that are not relevant here. My comments are specific about the post. Pollution. People here act as if Diwali does not cause pollution. It does. Now there can be a million other sources. And efforts should be made to reduce pollution in all those areas. What is there to disagree with? If only reason to do something is culture and religion and if it damanges anything, why not think about doing it in sustainable way? I can see what is going around. So attack what is wrong. For instance, if someone tells us to ban Gita, aruge and oppose it. There is no reason why one needs to ban Gita. Firecrackers do cause pollution. It is a fact.

In many cases, the US government used zero day vulnerability to snoop into data, and didn't ask or take the user data from platforms, there also still the populace hated it. Obama was hounded on NSA spying. After which they had to reform and platforms under pressure reduced their co operation. An example is apple refusing to open iphone.

We also lack a strong judicial system to help in case of undue violation of privacy by the state.

It's a logical fallacy, look it up. Newton's contribution towards science and maths were driven by the European culture, not religion. That's what my original comment was about. Again, argument from authority. Also, having open discussions with religious philosophers doesn't mean you subscribe to the religion itself.

In the sense, I don't think most people when they are 18 or 20 have a true sense of what their religion means. Or deeper understanding or reasoning of certain things. It is mostly forced upon. Be it burqa, hijab, sacred threads, turban or anything. But when there is a situation, when there is truly a choice, say a job interview, there is no written rule that you cannot wear burqa or hijab they mostly choose to not get their religion come in the way to getting that favourable outcome. I.e getting the job. Why is it so? When you truly have the choice, one chooses to ignore it, but when mandated against a choice, one tends to cling on to the choice. I'm not pro or against hijab.

India is a country were millions of parsi's from Iran migrated 12 20th century , millions from afganistan during their struggle with russia , from sri lanka, from bangladesh, from Tibet China and now from Burma. Do you know that most number of migrants come to India from Bangladesh and Pakistan? Please read the Citizenship act of 1955. It clearly says who is an illegal immigrant. Any body who is in India without a valid passport is illegal. This new bill excludes the people in the 6 communities from being illegal. All Illegal immigrants should be deported. Now, every country has the right to decide who can migrate. For example, US has EB5 visa to stop poor people from coming in, other countries have point system based on education age, then there is something called 'extreme vetting' for people from select countries. If India decides to relax immigration rules for minorities of these three countries, it is not discriminatory but a preference. These three countries are not secular countries. These are Islamic countries where Minorities are killed. There is no question about it. Did you know that in Assam, there are more refugees than assamees? Have you read about Assam Agitation? At this point, people who are protesting and throwing stones and burning buses, should educate themselves. Being secular does not mean you should illegal immigration.

"An attempt to address the list of ""simplified"" explanation that is floating around in an attempt to justify the Citizenship Amendment Fact","It discriminates against ALL muslims persecuted or not from anywhere. The NRC and CAA are two sides of the same coin when it comes to citizenship. The NRC is ""exclusionary"" in nature it's job is to identify the illegal immigrants to India and strip them of any indian citizenship as they are foreigners illegally in India. The CAA is ""inclusive"" in nature it's job is to grant indian citizenship to some of these illegal foreigners stripped of citizenship by NRC, based only on their religion targeted mainly at Hindus and ""persecution"" status in three neighbouring muslim countries Pak, Af, Bangla . The end result of NRC CAA is that ALL muslims , and some Hindus and Christians etc. will end up in refugee camps . But due to the stupid illogical selective criteria most of the non muslim refugees from Pak, Af, Bangla will get citizenship only because they were ""lucky"" to be born as non muslims in these country, while muslims and non muslims from other countries will continue to suffer. Yes, India is secular. Yes, CAA discriminates. That is a fact. CAA is highly discriminatory to ""other"" persecuted victims from the non muslim countries. There is no reason to treat a for e.g. Hindu foreigner from a muslim country as more special than a Hindu foreigner from a Hindu or Buddhist country. It is just plain ridiculous they are all foreigners and the victims or the persecutors religion doesn't make them special in anyway . The persecuted are the persecuted. They all feel the same pain, fear, anger and hatred. They are all victims of some kind of identity politics. It is totally inhuman to subject them to even more identity politics in the one place they found some sanctuary and a bit of peace and hope. They are all same and deserve to be treated fairly. This is not true if an Indian muslim , like most of the undocumented poor or those whose documents have been missing or damaged due to a natural calamity, is unable to produce any document to prove his citizenship then that muslim will face detention and possible forceful deportation to some foreign muslim country according to the whims of the government. A Hindu without document can still lie and say he is persecuted immigrant from Pak, Af or Bang and ask citizenship. A muslim will have no recourse. Lol. Then what is? Someone's ""feelings"" on the matter? That is exactly what this is about Do you believe and accept the constitution of India? Do you believe in secularism that says nobody should be treated differently because of their religion? Do you believe India should be a Hindu Rashtra with special rights only for Hindus?

When Indira Gandhi cracked down on BBC,"That's good, but you should see some people I know who would defend anything and give strawman arguments. But I digress. Regarding the TN news you mentioned, I haven't followed it well, so will get back after I go through it properly. But from what you've said, that seems extremely wrong. But right now, I'm not sure if the media were actually curtailed to not let out the news, is there a recent history of media dissent by the state government in TN. To get answers to those qns, I would have to read a bit. I might not agree here fully. If you compare the media in the US, there aren't a lot of crackdowns on media houses. A comedian Hasan Minhaj, Indian ethnicity and a religious minority but still manages to run a political show and has criticised the US government without a scratch on him. A lot of media outlets can use strong language against even their president, something for which you could go to jail here. I'm not saying we should follow suit, but there should be room for healthy dissent and the government should answer those qns. Also, opposition's role is to ensure the government is kept on its toes. Issues like BBC or Adani fiasco should be raised and govt should be forced to answer.

Blamed them for being ""weak"", which is why China ""dared"" to cross our border then. According to him, you needed a ""strong"" person like him in power, and then no country would dare mess with us. The rupee would magically strengthen against the dollar, and petrol would cost less than water. It would be a perfect India! Well, here we are. Modi is in power, the rupee is weaker than ever, petrol is more expensive than ever, and we still have border incursions. Why? Because these things are complicated. You can't just boast about the size of your chest. It takes years of effort to fix the issues he boasted about. Modi seems to be a marketing guy, not someone terribly interested in concerted effort. I'm happy to be United, and to support India. But as responsible citizens, it is also our job to point out the dangerous and divisive rhetoric that was used by Modi, when he was seeking power. We should keep talking about it, until future Leaders of ANY party understand that it's not okay to be divisive, or use dangerous rhetoric.",fvez11n,/r/india/comments/hc01o7/yesterday_the_government_said_there_is_no_soldier/fvez11n/,-1.0

This is what is call Anti National.,We do need to support the government when it comes to issues of national security and defense. The government represents the country and it is not the time to bring in internal politics and undermine the country on the international stage. Whether the government in power is BJP or Congress or whoever. What's wrong in staying united against china?

I'm not criticising anything. I've got nothing against diwali, it's not political for me or anything. I'm just asking whether it makes sense to dismiss the pollution caused by a very intense, highly polluting festival, on no better grounds than whataboutism. It's a strange line of argument you're trying to make. ""If we do a little bit of pollution for good reasons, like travel, every day, why can't we do a shitload of pollution for a less good reason on one day""? I presume one could have a diwali festival without all the pollution if there was a will to. But the first step is actually admitting it's an issue. As to your entirely unfounded accusation of hypocrisy, I as a European am against all the fireworks let off at New year, for the same reason.

As long as the NRC process isn't extended nationwide, claims of its nefariousness are overblown. However, the HM has claimed that NRC will be implemented nationwide. It will probably still not be, the costs of verifying 1.3B sets of documents are ridiculous. Normally rural poor folk would be apprehensive about having to prove citizenship.

The cutoff date of December 2014 for a 6 year stay requirement has been carefully chosen, so that non Muslims are automatically protected. To be clear, the problem with NRC is the process.

There are things our heroes did that were inhumane but we have decided that they are our heroes so they are, in some sense, our gods. Having said that if i really go back in history and see why all those movements started i will point out to you that they were a need of that time maybe it would hard to imagine given that we were not present then and it would especially be hard for a person who in any sense can't relate to the people who went through those times .

BJP Gujarat 2022 Manifesto.,"So, one has to have a connection with someone having good economic standing...? 1. Not getting a job can be because of no fault of the student, like an abrupt change in the market. 2. Why should we resort to creating mental and economic pressure, when the incentive of good earning from a job well done is enough? 3. This useless pressure is the reason for the lack of a good culture of exploration and innovation in our country. If we dream of being a leading economy on a per capita basis , we must enable our citizens to take risks. 4. This economic cost is a reason why many can't pursue a field of their passion. If we relax this constraint, the economy will have a net benefit in aggregate. 1. A decent standard of living and leisure is literally a directive principle of state policy. 2. Government spending is useless in ""current expenditure"" type of things. However, it's the good thing to do in ""capital investment"" type of things like infra, greenfield PSUs.

"The new Indian If Trump's supporters blame Antifa for having conspired to steal' the election from Trump, Modi's supporters are as convinced that Leftists, libtards, and Lootyens' are behind every attempt to criticise Modi's government and his policies","Trump supporters get all their information from an incredibly airtight right wing echo chamber that is completely and utterly separated from the mainstream news. The two spheres are light years apart. Trump supporters do not trust mainstream news outlets in the USA. They think the mainstream media is peddling lies and falsehoods, because they are all out to get Trump and destroy America. This is why Trump supporters are able to believe that the rioters were antifa. Trump said so, and Trump's word is law, and the mainstream media, as well as the FBI, and multiple law enforcement agencies in the govt, are lying liars who lie. This is not exactly the case in India. When Modi first got elected in 2014, right wing misinformation became mainstreamed in India in a way that hasn't happened in the USA. Republic TV is the biggest news channel in India. Remember how they spent months over the summer shrieking about Rhea Chakraborty and Sushant Singh Rajput. Vast segments of the population get their information from WhatsApp forwards, which the right wing has hijacked to spread their lies to a science. And there are very few progressive media outlets in India that are capable of combating the mainstream giants. The majority of them spend their time enabling Modi. Print media outlets have not been all that effective on this front either, and the few that do Caravan, Wire, Scroll, etc. are not widely read to really make much of a difference. The problem is much worse in India. The marked increase of privately owned media outlets, particularly news channels, happened around the same time as Modi got elected. And 24 7 news channels are how a lot of Indians digest their information today. They have played a huge role in mainstreaming unquestioning support for Modi, and suppressing all criticism of him. To use the comparison to America, it would be as if the whole country thought Fox News was actually decent and factual, and channels like Newsmax and OAN are respectable right wing avenues for getting factual information, rather than batshit insane conspiracy theory peddling shit shows.

Payal Mehta Violence caught on cctv said to be attack on a BJP workers home in Kasba,"which are totally law and order problems and have nothing to do with religion ""intolerance"" in a country where Madarsas brainwash children to hate idol worshipping polytheistic pagans Koran 9 5, 9 29, 3 28, 4 11, 21 98 and other similar verses and government funds these 'religious institutions' ""secularism"" in a country where non muslims cannot manage mosques and non christians can't manage churches but for Hindus Our Temples do not belong to us. In most of the states, Governments have passed acts and legislations to take over Hindu institutions including Temples, Mutts and Endowments. This has enabled the Government to interfere in the Temples' management, practices and rituals. Not just that, Temples' properties and income have also been usurped by the Government. The most outrageous fact is that the Government exerts such a control exclusively on the Hindu Temples the places of worship of other religions enjoy freedom and autonomy. This is a clear cut case of systematic discrimination and harassment. From education to ecology and culture to charity, Hindu Temples have played a pivotal role in shaping the Indian society. Today's India has become a battleground for the clash of civilizations, and the Hindu society is facing an existential threat. The need to revive the Temple eco system is more important than ever. But this cannot be achieved without freeing them from the clutches of the State. The Government's control over the Hindu Temples is unconstitutional and immoral. Hindu Temples belong to the Hindu society and the State must exit immediately. While the state governments control over 4 lakh out of an estimated 9 lakh temples across the country, there is no such control over Muslim and Christian religious bodies. In this backdrop, there are demands to amend The Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments HRCE Act 1951 , which allows the state governments to take over temples and maintain complete control over them and their properties. There are over 15 state governments which control only Hindu religious institutions, specifically temples right from the appointment of administrators to mandatory collection of 13 18 service charge. This takes away the community's right and resources to protect its interests. This, according to them, is discriminatory as only Hindu community suffers this kind of treatment. It violates the concept of secularism. Also, the Indian Constitution does not permit the State to run religious institutions. Those advocating for equality say that the process of taking control of temple riches was started by the Mughals and was followed by the British rulers. After Independence, the Jawaharlal Nehru government continued with the policy of controlling the temples by enacting the HRCE Act in 1951. To the contrary, there is no such control over mosques and churches. We demand that in the same way, temples should also be freed from any kind of control. The government must amend the Act, which is the root cause of the problem, said J. Sai Deepak, noted Supreme Court lawyer. He also pointed out that traditionally also the Raja king does not have the right over the wealth of the temple. How could Indian courts recognise Sharia based Muslim Personal Law while claiming to be secular? How could Central and State governments take over the management of Hindu temples if they were secular? How could a secular government provide financial assistance to educational institutions run by religious organisations? How could a secular government codify and modify Hindu personal law? How would the government extend the existing caste based reservations to minority religions if it were secular?",gwqvmer,/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/n3fvao/payal_mehta_violence_caught_on_cctv_said_to_be/gwqvmer/,0.75

When Indira Gandhi cracked down on BBC,"Ramchandra guha actually calls the current times as undeclared emergency and for a reason. You do more to hurt your argument than to support it by mentioning actions from indira's time that match perfectly to Modi's. Just like indira and the trade unions, Modi too has taken over government institutions like CBI, ED, election commission, etc. Modi's recent symbol has become the bulldozer for demolishing poor people's homes especially the minorities. This is an exact parallel to Sanjay Gandhi's beautification of the cities. Similarly, We rank the lowest in press freedom. Every news channel sings the same tune and even NDTV has been bought now and the change in their tone is brutally visible. Even Nepal, bhutan and Afghanistan rank above us. Activists and Journalists are thrown in jails for speaking against their policies and termed terrorists at the drop of a hat. Also all the income tax raids are strategically launched. There's no implication of a routine or it isn't a simple coincidence that they just happen to raid BBC after the documentary dropped. And BBC isn't free of hypocrisy and blame but the contents of the documentary hold some truth if not all of it. Otherwise modi wouldn't have banned it. It's not like a mere documentary can be a threat to the stability of our nation where on the other hand you have sadhus shouting through speakers about killing muslims in broad daylight in Delhi. Modi never addresses the rise of communal violence and tension in this country.

They are attending AAP party rally in Gujarat but don't even know who Kejriwal is Paise dekar bheed ikhata ho sakta hain par sach to nikal jaayega. Video Courtesy BBC,"So I'll give you a basic info about why they are there. From their surname, Parmar, I can understand that they belong to the Vankar category which comes under SC which I belong to too . Most Vankars were college educated but without jobs. Post Nationalisation of Banks in India in 1969, they were able to acquire jobs in the 14 banks that got nationalised then. Ever since then, they have been voting for Congress, as they were able to afford a better life. In the past 20 years since Modi, the relevance of Congress has diminished in Gujarat, and most SCs have been fed much hatred against BJP by the elders, who I believe might have reason to hate him. The caste discrimination in Gujarat was high back in the time, not that it is not present now, it still is, but in a lesser intensity. Then when a person from the SC community is disallowed for eg. riding a horse for his wedding, or keeping a moustache, which are thought of as upper caste things by upper caste people, and then there's little to no action on the perpetrators, the anger against administration and the ruling party boils up. Now since Congress is irrelevant in Gujarat, the only alternative is AAP. As with every rally, people are brought read bought in hordes from villages to show strength. Who is the leader is irrelevant they know the party symbol, and they press the button. The newer generation of educated SCs vote for BJP as they know how things have changed and keep themselves updated on the ongoings. But that's a minority. Most SC stay in villages, but they still do not make up enough to oust BJP from power, hence there's not much of a threat.",ivnk59r,/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/yponl2/they_are_attending_aap_party_rally_in_gujarat_but/ivnk59r/,0.75

I'm imagining it as something like, an image, where its starts with this. first they came for, and shows the first victims. It should have an image, a popular one would be better, of that event with a date on it. Hopefully on top of it all, a mixed crowd should be shown, all whom are supporting, but after each event, the victim group from the supporters should be not be there in the next image, as in, for eg, if bankers are there in the group, after an event that pisses of bankers, in the next image of the supporting group, the banker should be removed. So its like the supporters become less and less, but also show the govt getting more powerful after each event. So for eg, First they came for shows an image of the first Muslim getting lynched under it, the day and date should be shown. And then they came for Next major victim group, with an actual image of the event. Again, popular image is more better, as it will be recognized easily. It should continue , and then left as fill in blanks giving it a,to be continued vibe, for future groups, who will be in their target soon.

"Smriti Irani's son recently graduated from a foreign University. However, not a single Media house named the University.","Mostly because we massively overload them. While underfunding them. Delhi University has an undergrad intake of tens of thousands of students. Master's intakes of hundreds. Meanwhile there have been no permanent faculty hires in years, so now a majority of the lecturing is being done by Ad Hocs and Guest Lecturers who are basically PhDs and early career scholars who cannot grow in their fields because there is no job security and shit pay. And why is that? Because we neither support our unis, nor give them autonomy. They have regularly faced budget cuts, even as the government makes them take more and mroe students usually with each reservation reform because the brand value and demand for higher education is high. So they bow down to public pressure and arbitrarily increase seats. Meanwhile everyone wants to get in, and nobody likes being left out, so the application sizes are enormous. And the government rather than trusting them to select for themselves, imposes arbitrary central exams usually poorly designed. And with shit primary education, too many students getting in don't have basic skills so the colleges also need to focus on improving their language and reasoning abilities. Fact is we're simply asking too much of them and just not paying them enough. DU should honestly be half a dozen university instead of the super organization that it is incapable of functioning effectively because of its massive size. And we just need more universities. There are more good universities in a single US state than there are in the entirety of India. Unfortunately that requires the government to do something it hates. 1. Give more money 2. Give autonomy. Help the institutions build up, but stop imposing insane bureaucratic rules on them that destroy research capacity. Instead for the last 3 decades we've done the opposite. Fixing it would be a generational effort. Not gonna happen in a few years. And I'm not sure if we, as a people, have any sort of patience for it. We also need to fix our primary education, but that's not my primary area, so I don't have as much specific info for that.",ihjmlyi,/r/india/comments/w7co36/smriti_iranis_son_recently_graduated_from_a/ihjmlyi/,0.0

"""2 Judges Can't Decide"" BJP MP's Strong Objection On Same Sex Marriages","India is a country with majority population dependent on the government for 2 meals a day. The same country where there is no absolute free speech, the government tramples down on the rights of the people by using blasphemy laws and other arbitrarily defined hate speech laws. The same country where police can arbitrarily arrest any person on the basis of just suspicion and even kill the person in cold blood and get away with it. Despite all these problems, the liberals want to prioritise LGBTQ rights etc. What is the priority folks? Liberals in India are just wannabe westerns who constantly crave for white validation to feel progressive . They need this validation to feel superior to the other ""backward"" Indians who they percieve to be regressive and morally inferior. Indian liberals will only become relevant if they push for more individual rights first before campaigning for LGBTQ rights. Allow the people to question everything, including religion. Only then will we advance as a society , assimilate and develop a decent temperament for conversation. I'm not against LGBTQ BTW, I just don't understand why the liberals care so much about this issue when the Indian state, since 1947, has treated the Indian citizens like literal piece of shit with no individual rights.

Lakshadweep in Trouble!,"on another note 2019 Election Officer Coercion On 10 April 2019 Election Commission of India issued a notice to Prafu K Patel stating that his actions violated provisions under the Representation of the People Act, 1951. The commission reprimanded Patel for having issued a ""coercive"" request to Kannan Gopinathan, the collector for Dadra and Nagar Haveli, and withdraw any notices issued to Gopinathan or any other election officials ""during the election period."" Election Commission Officials state that Praful Patel called election officers to issue them direct instructions. Crucial interference from Patel came after Gopinath sent a notice to Mohanbhai Sanjibhai Delkar for actions that violated the model code. Praful Patel retaliated by issuing a notice to Gopinath which Election Commission Officials described as an act of political vengeance. 7 Since then, Kannan Gopinathan has been replaced with Sandeep Kumar Singh as collector. 2019 Daman Indigenous Land Clearing Protests Valuable seafront land along the 700 metre stretch from Moti Daman Lighthouse to Jampore beach is claimed to be owned by adivasi fishing communities who have lived there for generations as well as by NRI Damanese predominantly living in Leicester, UK. In December 2018, local residents received official looking documents purportedly instructed by Praful Patel ordering the confiscation of their land and demolition of homes to make way for development. 8 In January 2019 Praful Patel hosted a hastily arranged meeting with British MP Keith Vaz but managed to allay his fears about the case. 9 However, by November the bulldozing went ahead and the Daman protests began. On 3 November 2019, Daman Collector Rakesh Minhas issued a Section 144 order banning peaceful assembly of four or more persons, slogan shouting and the use of loudspeakers across the entire district and ordered the conversion of two High Schools into 'temporary jails'. 10 70 protesters were held in these 'temporary jails' and another 8 arrests were made. 11 Few of the adivasi fisherfolk were rehoused whilst most languished traumatised and homeless on the streets near the rubble of their razed homes. 12 As of March 2021 the site is now billionaire Binod Chaudhary of CG Corp Global's The Fern Seaside Luxurious Tent Resort offering tourist accommodation for 80US 57GBP 6000 rupees for night in a tent. 13 2021 suicide of Mohan Delkar Tribal rights advocate and Lok Sabha MP Mohanbhai Sanjibhai Delkar hanged himself at Hotel Sea Green in Mumbai on 22 February 2021 leaving a 15 page suicide note. 14 The note held politicians and administrative officials responsible for ""injustice"", ""insult"" and ""bias"" meted out to him and specifically named Praful Patel. 15 On 5 July 2020, Delkar had posted a video on Twitter threatening to resign as Lok Sabha MP because the local administration was ""hounding him"". Then on 19 September in parliament he raised the issue of ""misbehaviour"" by local officials ""as part of a conspiracy"" claiming that on Liberation Day 2 August , he was ""denied the right to address the people of the region as an MP"". 16 First Information Report FIR under Section 306 abetment of suicide , 389 Putting person in fear of accusation of offence, in order to commit extortion and 506 criminal intimidation and sections of Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe Prevention of Atrocities Act, 1989 was filed against Praful Patel, Daman Collector Sandeep Kumar Singh, former police superintendent Sharad Darade, and few politicians including BJP leader Fatehsinh V Chauhan who has a history of land grabbing disputes. 17 Delkar's son Abhinav has alleged that Patel threatened Delkar to pay 25 crore US 3.5 million or he would be implicated under PASA Act. 18 Save Lakshadweep Campaign 2021 Following the appointment of Praful Patel as the Administrator of Lakshadweep, a campaign against the new administrator's policies gained momentum. On 24th May 2021, SaveLakshadweep became a trending hashtag in Twitter India. The official twitter handle of Kerala Students Union the Kerala wing of NSUI was suspended for a tweet against Praful Patel on 23rd May 2021 19 . The campaign was mostly against the new administrations plans to deregulate alcohol and ban beef slaughter on the island. A majority of Lakshadweep's natives belongs to the Muslim community. It was claimed by locals that the administration was implementing Hindutva agendas.

I don't care about what BJP projects about RG Another mistake, it feels like you lack reading comprehension. We're not a truly two party system, it's not BJP or Congress. It neither BJP nor Congress in their current state for me. Do you know why Congress which is by no means a left leaning party and the intellectual left of India fails to appeal to the masses? Because of how to treat people with a different opinion. In the course of the couple of comments I've made, you have already taken an ""us vs them"" approach and have not tried to understand the point I'm trying to make. Instead you have gone on and insulted made personal attacks. Instead they do it with other minorities. Also, Congress has an appeasement policy towards Muslims, purely for political gain. Pick any number muslim neighbourhoods and point out what Congress have done to improve their lives? Again, just because I'm saying RG lacks credentials or Congress is bad, doesn't mean that Modi is good and BJP is good. Both are bad, it's just that I don't have to list what's wrong with Modi here, so I'm not doing it. Just because RG gave couple don't be a pedant and say there are more, I know there are more of interviews and sounded intellectual there, you think he has credentials to lead a country? He might be learning from his mistakes and probably has improved on the public speaking front, but if that makes you a worthy PM candidate, please nominate me, I can do both of those. My complain with RG is he's not there on merit, he has not held a serious position which he had to work for and I don't think that's the way forward for us.

You guys noticing what's happening in Sri Lanka?,"Firstly, I am not saying it, the great communist magazine the Atlantic is saying it. But I am guessing you didn't even read it before commenting. So here the sections which I felt are relevant. In case you feel I am quoting it out of context or other such things, go ahead read it from the link. ""The prime example of this is the Sri Lankan port of Hambantota. As the story goes, Beijing pushed Sri Lanka into borrowing money from Chinese banks to pay for the project, which had no prospect of commercial success. Onerous terms and feeble revenues eventually pushed Sri Lanka into default, at which point Beijing demanded the port as collateral, forcing the Sri Lankan government to surrender control to a Chinese firm. Our research shows that Chinese banks are willing to restructure the terms of existing loans and have never actually seized an asset from any country, much less the port of Hambantota.A Chinese company's acquisition of a majority stake in the port was a cautionary tale, but it's not the one we've often heard. It was the Canadian International Development Agency not China that financed Canada's leading engineering and construction firm, SNC Lavalin, to carry out a feasibility study for the port. We reviewed a second feasibility report, produced in 2006 by the Danish engineering firm Ramboll, that made similar recommendations to the plans put forward by SNC Lavalin, arguing that an initial phase of the project should allow for the transport of non containerized cargo oil, cars, grain to start bringing in revenue, before expanding the port to be able to handle the traffic and storage of traditional containers. Armed with the Ramboll report, Sri Lanka's government approached the United States and India both countries said no. But a Chinese construction firm, China Harbor Group, had learned about Colombo's hopes, and lobbied hard for the project. China Eximbank agreed to fund it, and China Harbor won the contract. This was in 2007, six years before Xi Jinping introduced the Belt and Road Initiative. Sri Lanka was still in the last, and bloodiest, phase of its long civil war, and the world was on the verge of a financial crisis. There is a bunch of detail in the Atlantic article about how it was financed and Sri Lanka chose the worst deal for itself. For a conflict torn country that struggled to generate tax revenue, the terms of the loan seemed reasonable. Some more details. When Sirisena took office, Sri Lanka owed more to Japan, the World Bank, and the Asian Development Bank than to China. Of the 4.5 billion in debt service Sri Lanka would pay in 2017, only 5 percent was because of Hambantota. The Central Bank governors under both Rajapaksa and Sirisena do not agree on much, but they both told us that Hambantota, and Chinese finance in general, was not the source of the country's financial distress. There was also never a default. Colombo arranged a bailout from the International Monetary Fund, and decided to raise much needed dollars by leasing out the underperforming Hambantota Port to an experienced company just as the Canadians had recommended Sri Lanka chose China Merchants, making it the majority shareholder with a 99 year lease, and used the 1.12 billion cash infusion to bolster its foreign reserves, not to pay off China Eximbank."" The Uganda international airport has been debunked already. Here is another communist article written by Maoist whose nation is extremely friendly to China. Again, I am quoting the part which I feel is relevant, but if you feel I am quoting it out of context , go ahead and read the article. ""Details published in a report in the Daily Monitor newspaper stated that Uganda allegedly had to surrender one of its national asset the Entebbe International Airport to China's EXIM Bank for defaulting on its loan repayments. In the aftermath of this development, Ugandan authorities have been consistently insisting on three issues The grace period is yet to expire and that the Ugandan government is confident of not defaulting on any obligations on repayment that the terms of the loans are semi concessional in nature and in line with Uganda's infrastructure financing programme. most of these claims are truthful.""

Besides, a household earning 3lpa is already in the top 10 of Indians. And it's impossible to go abroad with 3lpa. So foreign education is not accessible for 90 of Indians. My point stands.

The Indian side in its turn agreed to consider sympathetically the proposal enabling Pakistan to run a through train across India connecting Lahore and Dacca. Even cooperation and co ordination in the military fields came under discussion. India expressed concern about Chinese activities on the northern border of Kashmir and emphasised the concern they felt about a possible threat to Pakistan also from them. Ayub Khan, without batting an eyelid, shook his head gravely and promised to study the question with his military advisors. Little did the Indian side suspect that Pakistan would be handing over to the Chinese sizeable chunks of the territory in the northern part of Kashmir in return for China's support of Pakistan's claim for the annexation of Jammu and Kashmir. In fact, all our bilateral discussions and grandiose schemes came to practically nothing because of Pakistan's insistence that India should make substantial concessions with regard to Kashmir.

Students are not the state. But those Christians and Jewish teachers in private schools are because they are funded by state. The interior minister explicitly made an exception for them because he is a bigot. Their laicite law was passed in 1904 which said neutrality from those employed by state. But since 2004 they banned hijab for school students who don't work for the state, then banned parents from entering school premises with hijab, banned it from public beaches which was overruled by courts, now they have banned it in sports. Even for private religious schools which Muslims try to fund themselves, they regularly shut it down by influencing labor inspection officers. Here is one of the investigative reports where interior ministry pressured labor inspectors to pass laws against private Muslim schools. In public schools they regularly harass Muslim students like Sanghis do. They removed any vegetarian options and served pork exclusively.

Just got abused on the train by a hyper nationalist woman for a really absurd reason.,"If you don't have any experience, then don't engage, but if you really wanna, learn to disagree by agreeing first. People have this image that genz millennials are kinda edgy. To counter this stereotype, agree with other's opinions first, and show them how learnt you're in their own field. For example, in the above case, you could've told her that we were good and formulated a lot of mathematics and Ayurveda was one of the best of that time. Now once you've got her to agree with you, now it's your time to convince her that she's wrong. You've just destroyed that edgy teen stereotype by pleasing her with facts.To do further damage reduction, talk about hinduism and show her you're more well versed with Hinduism than her. This is not only to woo her, but the public too, so that either they don't interfere or bash you. Don't bring out that you're atheist or anything. Now to prove them wrong, you could've said that now the times have changed. Remember, you could've said that right at the beginning but that wouldn't have worked. It'll now because she's more vulnerable. You don't have to make other person feel guilty or inferior or anything, you just have to make them realize that they're wrong. One thing that people agree with most of the times is how talking about past wouldn't bring a change in the future, and how development makes other nations respect us, our opinions and our culture more. Now you've to properly gauge when to turn the wheels. Some people can be just hopeless and nothing you say will have any effect. In such situations, politely disengage do something impolite and they'll bring the duel right at your door.

Unpopular Opinion Your views on Hijab are immaterial to what's happening to the girls in Karnataka,"What people don't want to say is that all these things are happening to rile minorities up and bait them to protest. Once they start voicing their rights, it will be easier for propagandist media to brand them and their faith as regressive, anti national and unfit to live in india. Also, women is any community are associated with that community's dignity and self respect. That's why women have always been targeted by fringes to irk a community. To rile up a majority community, they show that women of that community are being mistreated by minorities. And similarly they try to agitate minorities by showing their women being targeted by a majority community. This has been a modus operandi of fringes for ages women have been commoditized for hate and propaganda. People don't want to acknowledge this but a majority of india has lost its critical thinking ability and is just going the way propaganda tells them to. It becomes easier for political partie to go to these people and declare that minorities are a threat to the country's culture. Talk to some brain washed extremist person in small towns or rural india, they often say that, ""We are ready. We are waiting for them to do something so that we can react and retaliate. We can do anything for our religion and country."" Majority communities have been made to commit horrible crimes by political parties by just packaging hate in the form of fictitious threat. Do you think those school going children really care about about uniform civil code? How does girls not wearing a hijab even help those school going boys?

It's just my opinion that in case of severe conflict of interest they would rather save their public image than worry about soldier lives. The point about looking at previous years of this govt in power was to highlight that this govt gets what it wants by hook or crook. There are enough examples of that.",fvf4z0t,/r/india/comments/hc01o7/yesterday_the_government_said_there_is_no_soldier/fvf4z0t/,-0.5

"BJP Blocks Parliament Panel Review Of PM CARES Fund, Coronavirus Response",We frankly all they're saying is that the PM Cares fund is outside the purview of the PAC. The real question we should be asking is what purview does it come under then? And who is the right auditing body for it? I agree that it's a war chest and disclosure isn't always mandatory but it could not be an unchecked account. Anyone an expert in parliamentary or auditing laws who can throw some light on this?,fxltvz8,/r/india/comments/hp2bgk/bjp_blocks_parliament_panel_review_of_pm_cares/fxltvz8/,-0.5
