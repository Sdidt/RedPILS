They didn't create any propaganda. India helped their civil war. They are puppet of India. Majority of them have no courage to talk anything about India.

And another simple explanation, when India initiated a road in Lipulekh Kalapani area (which according to Sugauli treaty) is part of Nepal. India never talked about it with Nepal. Because India dissolved the treaty without Nepal's agreement.

"Smriti Irani's son recently graduated from a foreign University. However, not a single Media house named the University.","Well, the thing about the future is that it's unpredictable. Road accidents are very common in foreign countries. Suppose the person who took a loan to study got involved in one. They are fucked right. They'll be in a mountain of debt with no way to repay it. But a rich person wouldn't be in a life ruining situation then. That's my reasoning why foreign education is limited to rich people. 

Besides, a household earning 3lpa is already in the top 10% of Indians. And it's impossible to go abroad with 3lpa. So foreign education is not accessible for 90% of Indians. My point stands.

Ambarsar was already being held captive in 1970 and India could have lost the Punjab state. She crushed that insurgency before it could ever peak; she didn't even let their supposed rebellion against the state start, taking out the face of the movement in the beginning, which is why the khalistani movement's majority has only been attacking unarmed Punjabi Hindus.

"An attempt to address the list of ""simplified"" explanation that is floating around in an attempt to justify the Citizenship Amendment Fact","This post has several factual errors that I cannot even start pointing out. 

I request everybody to do their own research.

India is a country were millions of parsi's from Iran migrated (12-20th century), millions from afganistan (during their struggle with russia), from sri lanka, from bangladesh, from Tibet (China) and now from Burma. 

Do you know that most number of migrants come to India from Bangladesh and Pakistan? 

Please read the Citizenship act of 1955. It clearly says who is an illegal immigrant. Any body who is in India without a valid passport is illegal. This new bill excludes the people in the 6 communities from being illegal. All Illegal immigrants should be deported. Now, every country has the right to decide who can migrate. For example, US has EB5 visa to stop poor people from coming in, other countries have point system based on education/age, then there is something called 'extreme vetting' for people from select countries. If India decides to relax immigration rules for minorities of these three countries, it is not discriminatory but a preference. These three countries are not secular countries. These are Islamic countries where Minorities are killed. There is no question about it. 

Did you know that in Assam, there are more refugees than assamees? Have you read about Assam Agitation? 

At this point, people who are protesting and throwing stones and burning buses, should educate themselves. Being secular does not mean you should illegal immigration.

It is easy to brand me a bhakt, or someone from quora or whatever...but educate yourself about our history...you do not have to go back several years...only upto 1947.",fbfc3c4,/r/india/comments/ebdeup/an_attempt_to_address_the_list_of_simplified/fbfc3c4/,2qh1q,2,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

BJP Gujarat 2022 Manifesto.,"Unpopular opinion, Delhi should not be a state.. 

it’s a piece of land for the government of India, to govern the whole country.. 

India is not alone in this..
It was a progressive move made when the country was created.. 

More reading here,

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_districts_and_territories

In a nut shell,
Indian constitution gives a set of power to states against central govt.. to make checks in power and balance.. 

Govt of India needs its own land to operate if states start rebelling against it.. 

Imagine if Delhi state govt starts to rebel, it can cripple the whole nation working properly.. 

No other state or representatives of the states will vote for this",ixzzyaw,/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/z5u6kf/bjp_gujarat_2022_manifesto/ixzzyaw/,3d4x4,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Just got abused on the train by a hyper-nationalist woman for a really absurd reason.,"If you don't have any experience, then don't engage, but if you really wanna, learn to disagree by agreeing first. People have this image that genz/millennials are kinda edgy. To counter this stereotype, agree with other's opinions first, and show them how learnt you're in their own field. For example, in the above case, you could've told her that we were good and formulated a lot of mathematics and Ayurveda was one of the best of that time.

Now once you've got her to agree with you, now it's your time to convince her that she's wrong. You've just destroyed that edgy teen stereotype by pleasing her with facts.To do further damage reduction, talk about hinduism and show her you're more well versed with Hinduism than her. This is not only to woo her, but the public too, so that either they don't interfere or bash you. Don't bring out that you're atheist or anything.

Now to prove them wrong, you could've said that now the times have changed. Remember, you could've said that right at the beginning but that wouldn't have worked. It'll now because she's more vulnerable. You don't have to make other person feel guilty or inferior or anything, you just have to make them realize that they're wrong. One thing that people agree with most of the times is how talking about past wouldn't bring a change in the future, and how development makes other nations respect us, our opinions and our culture more.

Now you've to properly gauge when to turn the wheels. Some people can be just hopeless and nothing you say will have any effect. In such situations, politely disengage ( do something impolite and they'll bring the duel right at your door. Also don't do any of the young vs old shit, that will feed to edgy teen stereotype and public will get swayed towards the opponent.)",hoqa7dm,/r/india/comments/rh2kcs/just_got_abused_on_the_train_by_a/hoqa7dm/,2qh1q,-1,-1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

When Indira Gandhi cracked down on BBC,"How can someone actually in their right frame of mind equate Indira regime's emergency to a mere banning of a propaganda laden documentary.

During Indira's emergency along with taking away press freedom there was a crackdown on trade unions as well. The Indira government reportedly banned trade union activity, strikes by workers and imposed fixed wages with no scope for bonuses. The workers that protested against this faced strict repression. Another controversial aspect of this period was Sanjay Gandhi’s mass sterilization program across the country and demolitions of slums for ‘beautification’ of cities with little to no prior notice to slum dwellers.

The most jarring aspect of Indira's emergency was Constitutional rights of people of India were suspended. Right to approach court for enforcement of Fundamental rights was taken away. Several of Gandhi’s political opponents were imprisoned including LK Advani, Atal Bihar Vajpayee, Morarji Desai and JP Narayan. A mass sterilisation programme was also enacted by Sanjay Gandhi. All powers were vested in the hands of the Union government. This all went on for 21 months. 

When BJP and Modi remind people of dark days of emergency, it's the culmination of all these draconian acts which took place when emergency was declared. 

Modi ever since 2014 has never suspended your right to approach the Supreme Court or a High Court for enforcement of your fundamental rights. There has been no curtailment of press freedom. Malicious channels like NDTV, Quint, The Wire have regularly peddled propaganda and post Adani takeover sepoys like Rubbish who are on payroll of Congress have flocked to Youtube. 

IT dept has statutory right to conduct raids. They don't have to wait for the cover of emergency to conduct raids on suspicious bodies. These BBC are habitual offenders in tax evasion. Acc to a 2012 report, thousands of public employees, including those at the BBC, were not paying their taxes at the source. Report was by public accounts committee in the United Kingdom (UK). In 2016, HM Revenue and Customs had reportedly begun an investigation into more than 100 BBC broadcasters amid allegations that they had underpaid their income tax and National Insurance contributions.

Just got abused on the train by a hyper-nationalist woman for a really absurd reason.,"Once was on a bus

And there was this lady approx 50 sitting next to me. She was pretty talkative with people around. Later on a muslim couple (because the male had that muslim cap and woman was wearing hijab) boarded the bus and sat somewhere in front way ahead of us.

As soon as they entered she began talking about Muslims and was like Hell lot of Islamophobic she literally went on to say ""all Muslims should be gathered around and killed with a bomb"" And this is problematic ofc but tbh I was tired af to even start an argument with her or to even disagree. 

But I wanted her to stop. So till this point she had no idea of my own identity. When she was going on with all of her shitty and problematic opinions about people of a religion. I pretended someone was calling me and I asked her to be quite for a second because I need to pick this up, I pretended to pick the call and answer with ""aslam e walaikum janab, hum raaste me hai aur aap se pohnch kar baat karte hai"" Translation: ""aslam e walaikum janab, I am on my way and would talk as soon as I reach"" 

Now it seemed to her like I was a Muslim and the rest of the journey she didn't even utter a word and was embarrassed af plus I didn't wanna get bothered again by starting a convo with her.",hor1py0,/r/india/comments/rh2kcs/just_got_abused_on_the_train_by_a/hor1py0/,2qh1q,-2,-2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

May 16th: “Shame on Govt for sending vaccines abroad”. June 1st: “Shame on Govt for not sending vaccines abroad”. Is this a joke? Dirty politicising of the Pandemic by the Congress perfectly captured by 3 Shashi Tharoor tweets.,"Let's be logical.

India's first batch of vaccines was ordered in January. The number of doses: Mere 15 million. To let you know we have a population of 1+ billion. Hence, more than 2 billion doses are required.

Poonawalla never thought he would require a billion + doses. What's implicit here? You're smart enough - hopefully - to infer that.

The second batch was ordered as late as 28 April.

You do realize that the second wave was raging at this time?

Yes, and it was anticipated. Almost no country has managed to escape the wrath of successive waves!

By comparison, many countries - even by PPP standard - have invested tons of cash in R&D whereas SII and BB, and others were left at their own mercies.

\*Not to mention we have NOT imported a SINGLE vax\*. The US by comparison has hoarded 300 million doses of AZ even after having more than sufficient stock to inoculated its citizens multiple times. Other countries are capable of inoculating their citizens MULTIPLE times.

India was, indeed, capable. Someone's mismanagement DOESN'T make my country any less capable.

So, Modi need not have to snap to make billions of doses come out of his ass.

"An attempt to address the list of ""simplified"" explanation that is floating around in an attempt to justify the Citizenship Amendment Fact","> From what I can see as of now it discriminates muslims from outside India (especially the Rohingyas). 

**It discriminates against ALL muslims (persecuted or not) from anywhere.** 

- The NRC and CAA are two sides of the same coin when it comes to citizenship.

- **The NRC is ""exclusionary"" in nature** - it's job is to identify the illegal immigrants to India and **strip them of any indian citizenship** as they are foreigners illegally in India.

- **The CAA is ""inclusive"" in nature** - it's job is to **grant indian citizenship to some** of these illegal foreigners stripped of citizenship by NRC, based only on their religion (targeted mainly at Hindus) and ""persecution"" status in three neighbouring muslim countries (Pak, Af, Bangla). 

- **The end result of NRC + CAA is that ALL muslims**, and some Hindus and Christians etc. **will end up in refugee camps**. But due to the stupid illogical selective criteria most of the non-muslim refugees from Pak, Af, Bangla will get citizenship only because they were ""lucky"" to be born as non-muslims in these country, while muslims and non-muslims from other countries will continue to suffer.

> I feel there is some merit to the point that giving citizenship to Muslims from Bangladesh Pakistan is not needed ... But please dont just say India is secular and it discriminates).

**Yes, India is secular. Yes, CAA discriminates. That is a fact.** CAA is highly discriminatory to ""other"" persecuted victims from the non-muslim countries. There is no reason to treat a (for e.g.) Hindu foreigner from a muslim country as more special than a Hindu foreigner from a Hindu or Buddhist country. It is just plain ridiculous - **they are all foreigners and the victims or the persecutors religion doesn't make them special in anyway**. 

**The persecuted are the persecuted. They all feel the same pain, fear, anger and hatred. They are all victims of some kind of identity politics. It is totally inhuman to subject them to even more identity politics in the one place they found some sanctuary and a bit of peace and hope. They are all same and deserve to be treated fairly.**

> Also, from what I can see, as of now the Indian Muslims are safe. 

This is not true - **if an Indian muslim**, like most of the undocumented poor or those whose documents have been missing or damaged due to a natural calamity, **is unable to produce any document to prove his citizenship then that muslim will face detention and possible forceful deportation** to some foreign muslim country according to the whims of the government.

A Hindu without document can still lie and say he is persecuted immigrant from Pak, Af or Bang and ask citizenship. A muslim will have no recourse. 

> Just saying secular and discrimination and Indian constitution is not an educated argument. 

Lol. Then what is? Someone's ""feelings"" on the matter? That is exactly what this is about - Do you believe and accept the constitution of India? Do you believe in secularism that says nobody should be treated differently because of their religion? Do you believe India should be a Hindu Rashtra with special rights only for Hindus?

I wasnt joking about mental illness tho..a quick scan of your post history and your username suggests autistic behavior.. I wouldnt ignore the advice to check up with a doctor If I were you....",ihqau89,/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/w8ib4s/bahut_jagah_hai_arey_nahin_jagah_hai_ft_congress/ihqau89/,3d4x4,-1,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Honest Rant,"Kejriwal was able to provide freebies in Delhi because Delhi government is one of the richest governments in the country and it has smallest area to govern.

Punjab is one of the poorest states in India and it's government is already heavily under debt. Also delhites tend to be more forgiving of the tax rise, but Punjabis will fight them tooth and nail if they increase taxes even a little bit. Kejriwal will not be able to execute his plans of any freebies in Punjab

Kejriwal would simply be unable to win over Punjab again, and his prospects of the future, with his credibility to the uninitiated will simply fall at the same time.",i040b4l,/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/tavmqa/honest_rant/i040b4l/,3d4x4,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Basically a party loyalist won over a educated deserving leader!,"You have to give it to Kharge, he has just committed career suicide. We all know that he will be blamed for the party's humiliating defeat in 2024 and be forced to step down and disappear from politics. Because of course pappu & pinky can never do anything wrong. The whole Congress president post is just a way to deflect responsibility from the dynasty. 

Also, if Khargeji is so popular, why doesn't he contest a Lok Sabha elections instead of sitting pretty on a Rajya Sabha seat? Surely, by winning 90%+ of votes among Congress delegates, he can convince some Congress voters to vote for him?",isxndff,/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/y7yl30/basically_a_party_loyalist_won_over_a_educated/isxndff/,3d4x4,-1,-1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
