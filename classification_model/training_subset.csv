And another simple explanation, when India initiated a road in Lipulekh Kalapani area (which according to Sugauli treaty) is part of Nepal. India never talked about it with Nepal. Because India dissolved the treaty without Nepal's agreement.

"Smriti Irani's son recently graduated from a foreign University. However, not a single Media house named the University.","Well, the thing about the future is that it's unpredictable. Road accidents are very common in foreign countries. Suppose the person who took a loan to study got involved in one. They are fucked right. They'll be in a mountain of debt with no way to repay it. But a rich person wouldn't be in a life ruining situation then. That's my reasoning why foreign education is limited to rich people. 

Besides, a household earning 3lpa is already in the top 10% of Indians. And it's impossible to go abroad with 3lpa. So foreign education is not accessible for 90% of Indians. My point stands.

Ambarsar was already being held captive in 1970 and India could have lost the Punjab state. She crushed that insurgency before it could ever peak; she didn't even let their supposed rebellion against the state start, taking out the face of the movement in the beginning, which is why the khalistani movement's majority has only been attacking unarmed Punjabi Hindus.

"An attempt to address the list of ""simplified"" explanation that is floating around in an attempt to justify the Citizenship Amendment Fact","This post has several factual errors that I cannot even start pointing out. 

I request everybody to do their own research.

India is a country were millions of parsi's from Iran migrated (12-20th century), millions from afganistan (during their struggle with russia), from sri lanka, from bangladesh, from Tibet (China) and now from Burma. 

Do you know that most number of migrants come to India from Bangladesh and Pakistan? 

Please read the Citizenship act of 1955. It clearly says who is an illegal immigrant. Any body who is in India without a valid passport is illegal. This new bill excludes the people in the 6 communities from being illegal. All Illegal immigrants should be deported. Now, every country has the right to decide who can migrate. For example, US has EB5 visa to stop poor people from coming in, other countries have point system based on education/age, then there is something called 'extreme vetting' for people from select countries. If India decides to relax immigration rules for minorities of these three countries, it is not discriminatory but a preference. These three countries are not secular countries. These are Islamic countries where Minorities are killed. There is no question about it. 

Did you know that in Assam, there are more refugees than assamees? Have you read about Assam Agitation? 

At this point, people who are protesting and throwing stones and burning buses, should educate themselves. Being secular does not mean you should illegal immigration.

It is easy to brand me a bhakt, or someone from quora or whatever...but educate yourself about our history...you do not have to go back several years...only upto 1947.",fbfc3c4,/r/india/comments/ebdeup/an_attempt_to_address_the_list_of_simplified/fbfc3c4/,2qh1q,2,2

Just got abused on the train by a hyper-nationalist woman for a really absurd reason.,"If you don't have any experience, then don't engage, but if you really wanna, learn to disagree by agreeing first. People have this image that genz/millennials are kinda edgy. To counter this stereotype, agree with other's opinions first, and show them how learnt you're in their own field. For example, in the above case, you could've told her that we were good and formulated a lot of mathematics and Ayurveda was one of the best of that time.

Now once you've got her to agree with you, now it's your time to convince her that she's wrong. You've just destroyed that edgy teen stereotype by pleasing her with facts.To do further damage reduction, talk about hinduism and show her you're more well versed with Hinduism than her. This is not only to woo her, but the public too, so that either they don't interfere or bash you. Don't bring out that you're atheist or anything.

Now to prove them wrong, you could've said that now the times have changed. Remember, you could've said that right at the beginning but that wouldn't have worked. It'll now because she's more vulnerable. You don't have to make other person feel guilty or inferior or anything, you just have to make them realize that they're wrong. One thing that people agree with most of the times is how talking about past wouldn't bring a change in the future, and how development makes other nations respect us, our opinions and our culture more.

Now you've to properly gauge when to turn the wheels. Some people can be just hopeless and nothing you say will have any effect. In such situations, politely disengage ( do something impolite and they'll bring the duel right at your door. Also don't do any of the young vs old shit, that will feed to edgy teen stereotype and public will get swayed towards the opponent.)",hoqa7dm,/r/india/comments/rh2kcs/just_got_abused_on_the_train_by_a/hoqa7dm/,2qh1q,-1,-1

"[Kanchan Gupta] When a journalist made an attempt to report rape-as-retribution by TMC for voting BJP , he was threatened into silence.

Please give reference or source with respect to the article we are discussing on. You are just posting the same baseless propaganda-rant.

Problem is exactly this approach will dilute the serious allegation and prevent the women from getting justice. Let there be probe and let the judicial process be carried out of this state (a demand of one party, as stated in the report). So that culprits are identified. If they are proved to be predominantly of any particular religion, then we can talk. Though i suspect they will be predominantly Hindus, but that's just my opinion.

I've collected all available records of UPA censoring free speech. Congress made 18 requests/day to Facebook and 15 requests/day to Google. That is when 70% of the country didn't even have access to the internet.,What Congress does is politics. That is what they are expected to do in a democratic system. BJP will do the same if in opposition. I cannot stand Congress because it has no democratic structure in the party and they have weakened the nation in every way when in power. Other than that as a political party they can contradict themselves like this. In politics no one is free of this.

When Indira Gandhi cracked down on BBC,"How can someone actually in their right frame of mind equate Indira regime's emergency to a mere banning of a propaganda laden documentary.

During Indira's emergency along with taking away press freedom there was a crackdown on trade unions as well. The Indira government reportedly banned trade union activity, strikes by workers and imposed fixed wages with no scope for bonuses. The workers that protested against this faced strict repression. Another controversial aspect of this period was Sanjay Gandhi’s mass sterilization program across the country and demolitions of slums for ‘beautification’ of cities with little to no prior notice to slum dwellers.

The most jarring aspect of Indira's emergency was Constitutional rights of people of India were suspended. Right to approach court for enforcement of Fundamental rights was taken away. Several of Gandhi’s political opponents were imprisoned including LK Advani, Atal Bihar Vajpayee, Morarji Desai and JP Narayan. A mass sterilisation programme was also enacted by Sanjay Gandhi. All powers were vested in the hands of the Union government. This all went on for 21 months. 

When BJP and Modi remind people of dark days of emergency, it's the culmination of all these draconian acts which took place when emergency was declared. 

Modi ever since 2014 has never suspended your right to approach the Supreme Court or a High Court for enforcement of your fundamental rights. There has been no curtailment of press freedom. Malicious channels like NDTV, Quint, The Wire have regularly peddled propaganda and post Adani takeover sepoys like Rubbish who are on payroll of Congress have flocked to Youtube. 

IT dept has statutory right to conduct raids. They don't have to wait for the cover of emergency to conduct raids on suspicious bodies. These BBC are habitual offenders in tax evasion. Acc to a 2012 report, thousands of public employees, including those at the BBC, were not paying their taxes at the source. Report was by public accounts committee in the United Kingdom (UK). In 2016, HM Revenue and Customs had reportedly begun an investigation into more than 100 BBC broadcasters amid allegations that they had underpaid their income tax and National Insurance contributions.
