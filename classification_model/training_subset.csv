"Smriti Irani's son recently graduated from a foreign University. However, not a single Media house named the University.","Well, the thing about the future is that it's unpredictable. Road accidents are very common in foreign countries. Suppose the person who took a loan to study got involved in one. They are fucked right. They'll be in a mountain of debt with no way to repay it. But a rich person wouldn't be in a life ruining situation then. That's my reasoning why foreign education is limited to rich people. 

Besides, a household earning 3lpa is already in the top 10% of Indians. And it's impossible to go abroad with 3lpa. So foreign education is not accessible for 90% of Indians. My point stands.

Ambarsar was already being held captive in 1970 and India could have lost the Punjab state. She crushed that insurgency before it could ever peak; she didn't even let their supposed rebellion against the state start, taking out the face of the movement in the beginning, which is why the khalistani movement's majority has only been attacking unarmed Punjabi Hindus.

"An attempt to address the list of ""simplified"" explanation that is floating around in an attempt to justify the Citizenship Amendment Fact","This post has several factual errors that I cannot even start pointing out. 

I request everybody to do their own research.

India is a country were millions of parsi's from Iran migrated (12-20th century), millions from afganistan (during their struggle with russia), from sri lanka, from bangladesh, from Tibet (China) and now from Burma. 

Do you know that most number of migrants come to India from Bangladesh and Pakistan? 

Please read the Citizenship act of 1955. It clearly says who is an illegal immigrant. Any body who is in India without a valid passport is illegal. This new bill excludes the people in the 6 communities from being illegal. All Illegal immigrants should be deported. Now, every country has the right to decide who can migrate. For example, US has EB5 visa to stop poor people from coming in, other countries have point system based on education/age, then there is something called 'extreme vetting' for people from select countries. If India decides to relax immigration rules for minorities of these three countries, it is not discriminatory but a preference. These three countries are not secular countries. These are Islamic countries where Minorities are killed. There is no question about it. 

Did you know that in Assam, there are more refugees than assamees? Have you read about Assam Agitation? 

At this point, people who are protesting and throwing stones and burning buses, should educate themselves. Being secular does not mean you should illegal immigration.

It is easy to brand me a bhakt, or someone from quora or whatever...but educate yourself about our history...you do not have to go back several years...only upto 1947.",fbfc3c4,/r/india/comments/ebdeup/an_attempt_to_address_the_list_of_simplified/fbfc3c4/,2qh1q,2,2

Just got abused on the train by a hyper-nationalist woman for a really absurd reason.,"If you don't have any experience, then don't engage, but if you really wanna, learn to disagree by agreeing first. People have this image that genz/millennials are kinda edgy. To counter this stereotype, agree with other's opinions first, and show them how learnt you're in their own field. For example, in the above case, you could've told her that we were good and formulated a lot of mathematics and Ayurveda was one of the best of that time.

Now once you've got her to agree with you, now it's your time to convince her that she's wrong. You've just destroyed that edgy teen stereotype by pleasing her with facts.To do further damage reduction, talk about hinduism and show her you're more well versed with Hinduism than her. This is not only to woo her, but the public too, so that either they don't interfere or bash you. Don't bring out that you're atheist or anything.

Now to prove them wrong, you could've said that now the times have changed. Remember, you could've said that right at the beginning but that wouldn't have worked. It'll now because she's more vulnerable. You don't have to make other person feel guilty or inferior or anything, you just have to make them realize that they're wrong. One thing that people agree with most of the times is how talking about past wouldn't bring a change in the future, and how development makes other nations respect us, our opinions and our culture more.

Now you've to properly gauge when to turn the wheels. Some people can be just hopeless and nothing you say will have any effect. In such situations, politely disengage ( do something impolite and they'll bring the duel right at your door. Also don't do any of the young vs old shit, that will feed to edgy teen stereotype and public will get swayed towards the opponent.)",hoqa7dm,/r/india/comments/rh2kcs/just_got_abused_on_the_train_by_a/hoqa7dm/,2qh1q,-1,-1

When Indira Gandhi cracked down on BBC,"How can someone actually in their right frame of mind equate Indira regime's emergency to a mere banning of a propaganda laden documentary.

During Indira's emergency along with taking away press freedom there was a crackdown on trade unions as well. The Indira government reportedly banned trade union activity, strikes by workers and imposed fixed wages with no scope for bonuses. The workers that protested against this faced strict repression. Another controversial aspect of this period was Sanjay Gandhi’s mass sterilization program across the country and demolitions of slums for ‘beautification’ of cities with little to no prior notice to slum dwellers.

The most jarring aspect of Indira's emergency was Constitutional rights of people of India were suspended. Right to approach court for enforcement of Fundamental rights was taken away. Several of Gandhi’s political opponents were imprisoned including LK Advani, Atal Bihar Vajpayee, Morarji Desai and JP Narayan. A mass sterilisation programme was also enacted by Sanjay Gandhi. All powers were vested in the hands of the Union government. This all went on for 21 months. 

When BJP and Modi remind people of dark days of emergency, it's the culmination of all these draconian acts which took place when emergency was declared. 

Modi ever since 2014 has never suspended your right to approach the Supreme Court or a High Court for enforcement of your fundamental rights. There has been no curtailment of press freedom. Malicious channels like NDTV, Quint, The Wire have regularly peddled propaganda and post Adani takeover sepoys like Rubbish who are on payroll of Congress have flocked to Youtube. 

IT dept has statutory right to conduct raids. They don't have to wait for the cover of emergency to conduct raids on suspicious bodies. These BBC are habitual offenders in tax evasion. Acc to a 2012 report, thousands of public employees, including those at the BBC, were not paying their taxes at the source. Report was by public accounts committee in the United Kingdom (UK). In 2016, HM Revenue and Customs had reportedly begun an investigation into more than 100 BBC broadcasters amid allegations that they had underpaid their income tax and National Insurance contributions.

Just got abused on the train by a hyper-nationalist woman for a really absurd reason.,"Once was on a bus

And there was this lady approx 50 sitting next to me. She was pretty talkative with people around. Later on a muslim couple (because the male had that muslim cap and woman was wearing hijab) boarded the bus and sat somewhere in front way ahead of us.

As soon as they entered she began talking about Muslims and was like Hell lot of Islamophobic she literally went on to say ""all Muslims should be gathered around and killed with a bomb"" And this is problematic ofc but tbh I was tired af to even start an argument with her or to even disagree. 

But I wanted her to stop. So till this point she had no idea of my own identity. When she was going on with all of her shitty and problematic opinions about people of a religion. I pretended someone was calling me and I asked her to be quite for a second because I need to pick this up, I pretended to pick the call and answer with ""aslam e walaikum janab, hum raaste me hai aur aap se pohnch kar baat karte hai"" Translation: ""aslam e walaikum janab, I am on my way and would talk as soon as I reach"" 

Now it seemed to her like I was a Muslim and the rest of the journey she didn't even utter a word and was embarrassed af plus I didn't wanna get bothered again by starting a convo with her.",hor1py0,/r/india/comments/rh2kcs/just_got_abused_on_the_train_by_a/hor1py0/,2qh1q,-2,-2

May 16th: “Shame on Govt for sending vaccines abroad”. June 1st: “Shame on Govt for not sending vaccines abroad”. Is this a joke? Dirty politicising of the Pandemic by the Congress perfectly captured by 3 Shashi Tharoor tweets.,"Let's be logical.

India's first batch of vaccines was ordered in January. The number of doses: Mere 15 million. To let you know we have a population of 1+ billion. Hence, more than 2 billion doses are required.

Poonawalla never thought he would require a billion + doses. What's implicit here? You're smart enough - hopefully - to infer that.

The second batch was ordered as late as 28 April.

You do realize that the second wave was raging at this time?

Yes, and it was anticipated. Almost no country has managed to escape the wrath of successive waves!

By comparison, many countries - even by PPP standard - have invested tons of cash in R&D whereas SII and BB, and others were left at their own mercies.

\*Not to mention we have NOT imported a SINGLE vax\*. The US by comparison has hoarded 300 million doses of AZ even after having more than sufficient stock to inoculated its citizens multiple times. Other countries are capable of inoculating their citizens MULTIPLE times.

India was, indeed, capable. Someone's mismanagement DOESN'T make my country any less capable.

So, Modi need not have to snap to make billions of doses come out of his ass.

"An attempt to address the list of ""simplified"" explanation that is floating around in an attempt to justify the Citizenship Amendment Fact","> From what I can see as of now it discriminates muslims from outside India (especially the Rohingyas). 

**It discriminates against ALL muslims (persecuted or not) from anywhere.** 

- The NRC and CAA are two sides of the same coin when it comes to citizenship.

- **The NRC is ""exclusionary"" in nature** - it's job is to identify the illegal immigrants to India and **strip them of any indian citizenship** as they are foreigners illegally in India.

- **The CAA is ""inclusive"" in nature** - it's job is to **grant indian citizenship to some** of these illegal foreigners stripped of citizenship by NRC, based only on their religion (targeted mainly at Hindus) and ""persecution"" status in three neighbouring muslim countries (Pak, Af, Bangla). 

- **The end result of NRC + CAA is that ALL muslims**, and some Hindus and Christians etc. **will end up in refugee camps**. But due to the stupid illogical selective criteria most of the non-muslim refugees from Pak, Af, Bangla will get citizenship only because they were ""lucky"" to be born as non-muslims in these country, while muslims and non-muslims from other countries will continue to suffer.

> I feel there is some merit to the point that giving citizenship to Muslims from Bangladesh Pakistan is not needed ... But please dont just say India is secular and it discriminates).

**Yes, India is secular. Yes, CAA discriminates. That is a fact.** CAA is highly discriminatory to ""other"" persecuted victims from the non-muslim countries. There is no reason to treat a (for e.g.) Hindu foreigner from a muslim country as more special than a Hindu foreigner from a Hindu or Buddhist country. It is just plain ridiculous - **they are all foreigners and the victims or the persecutors religion doesn't make them special in anyway**. 

**The persecuted are the persecuted. They all feel the same pain, fear, anger and hatred. They are all victims of some kind of identity politics. It is totally inhuman to subject them to even more identity politics in the one place they found some sanctuary and a bit of peace and hope. They are all same and deserve to be treated fairly.**

> Also, from what I can see, as of now the Indian Muslims are safe. 

This is not true - **if an Indian muslim**, like most of the undocumented poor or those whose documents have been missing or damaged due to a natural calamity, **is unable to produce any document to prove his citizenship then that muslim will face detention and possible forceful deportation** to some foreign muslim country according to the whims of the government.

A Hindu without document can still lie and say he is persecuted immigrant from Pak, Af or Bang and ask citizenship. A muslim will have no recourse. 

> Just saying secular and discrimination and Indian constitution is not an educated argument. 

Lol. Then what is? Someone's ""feelings"" on the matter? That is exactly what this is about - Do you believe and accept the constitution of India? Do you believe in secularism that says nobody should be treated differently because of their religion? Do you believe India should be a Hindu Rashtra with special rights only for Hindus?

That is not how GST works. GST is collected in producer states, and then split between producer and consumer state. This is by design because if we don't do it, states are going to start imposing cess/taxes on interstate trade breaking down federalism.

Congress and Ayodhya,"You said it yourself - an atheist leader that is defined by their atheism. The suppression of the Uyghurs by the CCP can be put down to Han Chinese supremacy or communism, but not atheism.

Stalin's purges, the Khmer Rouge, atrocities in North Korea - you can classify these all as Stalinism, Juche, Pol Pot-ism (is that a thing?) or whatever. That they happened in countries with atheist regimes is entirely incidental.

The Holocaust is also a pretty good example. There was industrial scale murder of Jews, Slavs (predominantly Eastern Orthodox) and communists. (mainly atheist) But the Third Reich is not remembered as a fundamentalist Catholic state, rather a fascist one.

> Facebook Inc said U.S. regulators have cleared its $19 billion acquisition of mobile messaging service WhatsApp, even as the Federal Trade Commission warned the two Internet companies on Thursday that they must not backtrack on commitments to user privacy.

> The FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection, in a letter to the two companies on Thursday, said WhatsApp must adhere to its current privacy practices after the merger, including a promise not to use WhatsApp users’ personal data for targeted ads.

> “If the acquisition is completed and WhatsApp fails to honor these promises, both companies could be in violation of Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act and, potentially, the FTC’s order against Facebook,” the letter from Jessica Rich, director of the consumer bureau, read.

Lakshadweep in Trouble!,"Do plants feel pain?

The simple answer is that, currently, no one is sure whether plants can feel pain. We do know that they can feel sensations. Studies show that plants can feel a touch as light as a caterpillar’s footsteps. But pain, specifically, is a defense mechanism. If something hurts humans, we react instinctually to it—“fight or flight”—as do other animals. But plants don’t have that ability—nor do they have nervous systems or brains—so they may have no biological need to feel pain. We just don’t know.

> The BJP and its relentless propaganda have brought out the worst in Indians, and it looks like things will be going downhill for a while now.

That is a very true observation, and I agree with you. In fact, this is the greatest political challenge that the Congress has to overcome. Many of their own supporters, who are polarised by the constant media propaganda of ""us vs them"", feel angry at the Congress leadership for not behaving aggressively like a Modi or Yogi or the Sangh and thus consider the Congress ""weak"".

However in every country there's some basis of division that politicians use( like racial division in USA).In India it is cast as well as religion which is somewhat unfortunate cause it surely creates a divided society. 

But most importantly it is the economical development of a country that shapes the society. So India if develops well, then education will spread too and then less chance of Pakistan like fanaticism.

But yeah just like Islam transformed to jihad , I hope no religion take that journey cause that's harmful.

Congress and Ayodhya,"> Priyanka is not channeling Mohandas Gandhi's Hinduism, she's playing hindutva light. 

What about this statement from Priyanka Gandhi is Sanghi Hindutva:

> *The world, and our own sub-continent's history and culture, bears the indelible imprint of Ramayana. The Indian psyche has always been inspired and encapsulated the spirit of Dharma, righteousness, duty, sacrifice, compassion, love, bravery and service, that runs through Ramayana - from north to south, from east to west, the 'Ramkatha' has manifested itself in immeasurable forms - just as the Lord has infinite incarnations, 'Ramkatha' has infinite forms.*

> *Ram is courage, Ram is unity, Ram is tolerance, Ram is fraternity. Ram belongs to everyone. Lord Ram is the good and well being of all. This is why Lord Ram is called 'Maryada Purshottam' (the epitome of principled conduct and righteousness).* 

> *Lord Ram symbolises sacrifice as also shelter. Ram belongs both to 'Sabri' as also to 'Sugriv'. Ram belong to 'Valmiki' as also to 'Bhasa'. Ram belongs to 'Kamban' as also to 'Ezhuthachan'. Ram belongs to 'Kabir', to 'Tulsidas' and to 'Raidas'. Ram personifies each one of us.*

> *Ram is an assimilation of all cultures, castes, class and religions and beyond any such barriers of language, regions or castes. Mahatma Gandhi's 'Raghupati Raghav Raja Ram' bestows divine wisdom and equanimity and Waris Ali Shah said, 'Rab is Ram'. Noted poet Maithali Sharan Gupt, described Ram as ""the strength of the oppressed and the voiceless"", while Mahapran Nirala described Lord Ram in his classical words as ""the power of eternal truth"".*

> *The 'Bhoomi poojan' ceremony of Ram Mandir in Ayodhya has been scheduled for August 5. Hope this event becomes a celebration of national unity, brotherhood and cultural harmony in accordance with the message of Lord Ram and with his blessings.*

Well I can agree with you on that. As that has happened in Assam as well. But as an Indian I do want something like NRC to legitimize the citizenship.

Usually people have documents needed to produce. But not always though. There will always be people, especially in a country like India, who might not be able to produce documents. I wonder what can be done for them. A relative of the 5th president of India isn't in the NRC. Also it has been fairly easy for people to appeal in case they were left out of NRC.

Argument from authority. It's a logical fallacy, look it up. 

Newton's contribution towards science and maths were driven by the European culture, not religion. That's what my original comment was about. 

>!Don't forget Neils Bohr(Taoist), Werner Heisenberg(Had conversation with Aurbindo Ghosh, a prominent Hindu Philosopher) Schrodinger (Named his dog 'Atman' and himself wrote many times in his notes that The Upanishads are the best).

Again, argument from authority. Also, having open discussions with religious philosophers doesn't mean you subscribe to the religion itself.

He clarified however that, ""I am not an atheist"", preferring to call himself an agnostic, or a religious nonbeliever. Einstein also stated he did not believe in life after death, adding ""one life is enough for me."" He was closely involved in his lifetime with several humanist groups.

Kejriwal says ’The Kashmir Files’ is a ‘jhoothi’ (fake) film. The Chief Minister of Delhi is now officially a Genocide denier,"> why there’s militancy in kashmir?

Islamism. Jihad

>Why every kashmiri Muslim hate Indian occupation right now? It was never the case before 1990. So why?

Bullshit. Just one look at sheer numbers of the militants around 1990 and around today will tell you that your assertions here are bullshit.

Hatred against Indian state and Islamism was there before 1990. It peaked in 1990 when the veneer of 'kashmiriyat' and 'azaadi' was torn and the full-blown jihad was exposed.

My language and logical skills are fine enough to respond to your petty comments. I’ve a thousand things to do apart from being a spokesperson unlike you so forgive me if my comment was all over the place. 

Anyway, let’s come to the point. I’ll ignore a couple of comments you made above because they’re full of shit. You think if you didn’t intervene into Kashmir, it would have become Syria/or some other extremist state. You’re an idiot, I’ll just say that and move on.

Now, you accusing me of of being a Pakistani parrot, see that’s the problem with you people. The moment someone speaks the truth, you just label them Gaddar, Pakistani, or terrorists or something else that feeds your justification of what’s happening in Kashmir. 

Again I’ll say, Kashmir was never a part of India. It was a princely state, the king made a pact with Nehru about Indias intervention into Kashmir to fight Pakistan incursion but it was never followed by india in terms of plebiscite.

Every kashmiri today hates Indian occupation. They’re the people who had been living there and it’s their right to decide who they want in the form of government. That’s called democracy which we don’t see much under Modi government btw. Whatever you know, you learned it from Indian sources and that’s not necessarily true all the time. No country would put something in their textbooks or acknowledge publicly their wrongdoings. For example, text books in Pakistan doesn’t mention about Kargil and their defeat. Similarly, Indian text books will never show the true MAP of india, that’s right the map you see is not true. India claims entire Kashmir as it’s part but some park it POK and Akashi China which is not ours. Google it or look a world map by UN.

P.S. I don’t think you know the history very well my friend. If you knew, you wouldn’t be arguing here. As a note, I would highly suggest that you visit Kashmir and see how Indian army treats all the civilians. Oh I’m sorry, they’re terrorists not civilians right?

Everything is going exactly as planned to blame Diwali for pollution.,"I disagree. Hinduism has endured a lot AND lost a lot. All the area west of the modern Republic has been stripped of its Hindu population, history, and culture. Just look at Afghanistan and Balochistan for example. Panini standardized Sanskrit while living in what is today Peshawar. Is there even any Sanskrit writing anywhere in Peshawar today?

The lesson from the 1,000 year war against Hinduism is that we need to fight and stop it at the bud, not watch from a distance like Hindu kings did during the Arab conquest of Sindh, and then fight for survival against a strong enemy. INC under pappu and mataji would not have destroyed Hinduism but would've bled it by a thousand cuts, especially through the Hindu-haters who ran the govt from the NAC. The effects of that would've been seen only generations later. 

Indira Gandhi was not anti-Hindu. However much she destroyed the economy and democracy, she was not bent on destroying Hinduism. The same cannot be said of the current crop of INC leaders.

We were never such a restrictive or oppressive religion, we're not like Islam or Christianity. Hinduism in its original form was more about spirituality and freedom.

Unpopular Opinion : Your views on Hijab are immaterial to what's happening to the girls in Karnataka,"I don't have a definitive opinion yet. But I have noticed this.

I see everyone telling it should be one's choice. And not be forced. But why don't people enforce that choice or freedom when they yearn for a favourable outcome.

Now given the situation of a school, you are probably not personally held responsible for wearing or not wearing a specific type of clothing. In the sense, I don't think most people when they are 18 or 20 have a true sense of what their religion means. Or deeper understanding or reasoning of certain things. It is mostly forced upon. Be it burqa, hijab, sacred threads, turban or anything.

But when there is a situation, when there is truly a choice, say a job interview, there is no written rule that you cannot wear burqa or hijab etc...yet they mostly choose to not get their religion come in the way to getting that favourable outcome. I.e getting the job.

Why is it so? When you truly have the choice, one chooses to ignore it, but when mandated against a choice, one tends to cling on to the choice.

I'm not pro or against hijab. I haven't made my up mind. Just looking for a reasonable justification from both sides as to why and why not.

What later ""civilizations""? There were no civilizations in mediaeval Europe. The whole continent was inhabited and converted into farmland. A civilization implies a particular region or river valley where cities are established.

Force wasnt used initially. As per the 1993 agreement , they shouldnt be coming up with any constructions as its a transitional area. 

But they did. 

Then India protested and a diplomatical meeting is jeld and china agreed to dismantle these temporary posts and withdraw the company.

When neither 1993 agreement and the recent comittments are honoured , its the duty of govt to use army to force the agreements. 

If this is not done next year they will pitch tent at finger 2. No amount of crying will bring back the lost territories.

How the Pakistani Lobby in the US/West has infiltrated and influenced academic and historical studies of India and Hinduism,"The dream of the Muslim homeland had had strange consequences.

The newspaper advertisements called it “manpower-export.”

The business was organized. Like accountants studying tax laws, the 
manpower export experts of Pakistan studied the world’s immigration laws and competitively gambled with their emigrant battalions: visitor’s visas overstayable here (most European countries), dependents shippable there (England), student’s visas convertible there (Canada and the United States), political asylum to be asked for there (Austria and West Berlin), still no visas needed here, just below the Arctic Circle 
Finland). They went by the planeload. Karachi airport was equipped for this emigrant traffic. Some got through; some were turned back. 

Abroad, the emigrants threw themselves on the mercies of civil-liberties organizations. They sought the protection of the laws of the countries where the planes had brought them. They or their representatives spoke correct words about the difference between poor countries and rich, South and North. They spoke of the crime of racial discrimination and the brotherhood of man. They appealed to the ideals of the alien civilizations whose virtue they denied at home. 

From: Among the Believers: An Islamic Journey by V S Naipaul. 

The Pakistanis are more numerous, and have been far longer in the West. Besides which, the Pakistani government spends a lot of money on such lobbyist groups.

It's unfortunate that even your ""educated"" doctor family has lost its humanity in pure selfishness.

Many comedians in the West make fun of the mismanagement of their country of origin but they don't stoop that low.
All the themes/problems acknowledged by Vir Das in the video were either half-baked or one-sided. I do find merit in some subjects but a whole action is an irresponsible act, spelled on the wrong platform.

Like:
1- Rape: ""We"" worship women during the day and rape them at night. Thank God Vir Das didn't add 'We come from an India where we cover women from head to toe and tear their clothes at night' otherwise his core audience would get hurt and things would get communal. And every sane person is aware of this heinous crime and tries his best not to let it happen anywhere in any form.

However, on 20th November 2019, Home Minister Amit Shah declared during a parliamentary session that the register would be extended to the entire country. The register was first prepared after the 1951 Census of India and since then it has not been updated until recently.The North-East Indian state of Assam has become the first state in India where the updating of the NRC is being taken up to include the names of those persons whose names appeared in the NRC of 1951 and are still alive; and/or of their presently living descendants who have permanent residence within the state.

As far as I know, most communist regimes in history have treated religion as a matter of convenience. Following the Bolshevik revolution, the USSR tried to stick to classical Marxism, advocating focus on internationalism rather than patriotism. But when the Soviets were reeling under the shock of Operation Barbarossa, Stalin invoked Russian patriotism, and a significant role in that was played by the Russian Orthodox Church, which was then granted various privileges. China has been actually meddling in Tibetan Buddhism, installing their own Panchen Lama as a counterweight to the Dalai Lama. Vietnam has also always had a strong Buddhist ethos.

Another low for Punjab. Shiv Sena leader shot dead in front of Police. [Source: The Tatva India],"I mean that's a nice ways to say _i will not listen to the other side_ I'd recommend you that should try sometimes.

And my philosophy is not _your heroes, our terrorists_, i am trying to convince you that there is no _true_ stories, no heroes in real life...i cant remember the name of that essay but it states that there are only _great_ men and these men we like to call _great_ are indeed a menace to society, so thats what I am trying to say. There are things our _heroes_ did that were inhumane but we have decided that they are our heroes so they are, in some sense, our gods. 

Having said that if i really go back in history and see why all those movements started i will point out to you that they were a need of that time (maybe it would hard to imagine given that we were not present then and it would especially be hard for a person who in any sense can't relate to the people who went through those times).

So maybe yes. The people you call terrorists were made by circumstances and the overwhelming majority was simply trying to survive and save their loved ones. Remember the people you say were terrorists were also human beings who got hurt and _someones_ neglected their pain and when they burst out crying they were hammered down. I can't see how this is fair.

If the Chinese had not released them we would have never known about them. Indian government literally disowned our own soldier.

I'm just reading out the facts for you.


>By saying that no chinese post have come up on Indian land, Modi has effectively relinquished all claims on points finger 4 and beyond. By Modi's admissions its china's land now. 

I'm not here to defend modi. You can abuse him as you like. 

Your OP misinterpreted the statement of MIA by army. So I pointed out the definition and the current situation in Aksai chin. 


>It cannot be denied atleast 20 soldiers died. Did Indian soldiers cross border and we accidentally invaded China or did they come over and killed our soldiers.

Read the 1993 agreement between India and China, 
China patrols upto finger 2 and India upto finger 8 are allowed until final settlement is reached. 

Brawl happened at finger 4. Agreement by no means relenquished the claim on aksai chin. But allows Chinese to patrol the land. 

. Losing 1962 war resulted in LAC and further agreements allowed chinese patrols upto finger 2. 

Like POK, Aksai chin is occupied by China, is Claimed by India but not controlled by India.. For lack of terminology area between finger 2 and 8 serve as temporary buffer until final settlement is reached.


>It also raises the questions, if no encroachment happened. Where did the galwan brawl take place?

At Finger 4 area where Chinese allowed to patrol but not allowed to build permanent constructions. 

"">Did Indian soldiers cross border and we accidentally invaded China or did they come over and killed our soldiers.

As Chinese allowed up to finger 2 and India up to finger 8, denying either party to patrol upto allowed areas or constructing between these two will be breach of agreement.

Brawl happened at 4 so, both the parties remained with in their agreed limits. 

So neither.

As I was saying, it's not like a waghah- attari border where it's clearly demarcated international border. Where if you accidentally take few more strides you end up in others territory.

"An attempt to address the list of ""simplified"" explanation that is floating around in an attempt to justify the Citizenship Amendment Fact","I'm still a little bit skeptical, still on the fence, about this whole issue and want additional clarification:

>Indian Muslims will now require extraordinary proof

What is the extraordinary proof that will be required and how will it be different from the proof that non-Muslim-non migrants will require?

If you are not in the special case covered by the CAA, you'll be subject to rest of The Citizenship Act, 1955, which lays out [four principal ways](https://indiancitizenshiponline.nic.in/acquisition1.htm) through which Indian citizenship can be acquired (Birth, Descent, Registration and Naturalization). Wouldn't a lot of people be eligible at least to acquire citizenship by naturalization? As far as I know, the 1955 act applies to every person irrespective of their religion. Only the CAA lays out a special condition for non-muslim migrants from three countries, that of a reduced time (five years) to be eligible for naturalization.

The purpose of the NRC would be to make sure that everybody tagged as an Indian citizen has the documented proofs that establishes at least one of the four principal requirements under the 1955 act, namely Birth, Descent, Registration and Naturalization.

For example, one of the proofs would be something that can establish that you have been a resident of India for 12 years, so that you're eligible for citizenship by naturalization. My understanding is that it's not that hard to demonstrate that you have been resident in India for twelve years for most people.

It might be hard for the homeless but wouldn't that be a problem for everybody? Including non-muslims who aren't migrants? Because the CAA only applies to non-muslims **who are also** migrants from those three countries and have been a resident of India since at least 31 December 2014.

And even if you don't have documented proof there are other provisions [such as witnesses or local proofs supported by members of the community, as clarified by the MHA Spokesperson yesterday](https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/no-indian-will-have-to-prove-ancestry-common-documents-will-be-enough-mha-1630201-2019-12-20).

Who is saying that? I don't see the person who you're responding to saying that. I didn't say that.

Even in Assam, where they've already implemented the shitshow, they haven't managed to kick out even 1 bangladeshi.

What they are doing is building detention camps, where they plan to keep people they don't have papers to deport.

Any sane person should panic about the hoops they are going to have to jump through together with 1.3 billion Indians, how devastating it is going to be for our fellow citizens without the privilege of having houses that don't flow away with flood waters and all belongings including papers, the effect this distraction is going to have on the economy, and the damage the act itself is doing to the secular constitution of this country.",fbtaks5,/r/india/comments/ee11sp/the_picture_pretty_much_sums_up_the_ideology_of/fbtaks5/,2qh1q,0,-1

I condemn and speak against violence perpetrated in the name of religion and justifying it in the name of spreading the word of god.

This is an issue of wording. The words you used tend to show that you're okay if hindus or any other religions are in the centre of everything. India has seen several mob lynchings in last six years, thousands of unlawful arrests, destruction of life and property of religious minorities, and violence planned and executed in the name of god. 

It's been one year of violence in Universities like JMI, AMU, and JNU, and I haven't seen anyone even accepting that they did it. They couldn't arrest any student in these cases because that's a part of propoganda and even after fabricating truths they couldn't get away with. The violence was perpetrated by the agents of the ruling party to help them mould a certain news, and they got away with it. What about that?

What about Gauri Lankesh and other journalists killed by saffron mobs? What about people killed on 'suspicion' of carrying beef, which was never substantiated? What about professors lynched and tried to be burnt? What about women and children raped? What about animals raped? What about shaming and arresting an actress on possession of weed while several 'saints' get away with it easily?

Girls, at the time of admission, had specifically signed a clause, agreeing to not wear Hijab inside the class. Then in December 2021 these girls out of the blue decided to wear Hijab inside the classroom. Take note that entry in campus wearing a Hijab was never denied. The girls themselves chose to sit outside the gate to register their protest.

Here these girls are in clear attempt to breach the contract between them and the college. Right to wear anything is null because the contract supersedes it. The query whether right to profess supersedes the contract is sub-juris.

In all this, I do not see how college is at fault. The college is in-fact a victim of attempted breach of contract here and is now being bullied and projected as some unjust entity.

I've collected all available records of UPA censoring free speech. Congress made 18 requests/day to Facebook and 15 requests/day to Google. That is when 70% of the country didn't even have access to the internet.,"First of all that is not what I said; it is one thing to criticize the current government's policies, it is quite another to claim that the country had more freedoms prior to the current government coming to power. The entire narrative of the opposition has been that ""freedom"", ""democracy"", ""secularity"", were part of the old India and not the new India, which is entirely false, and needs to be called out as false.

Asking Twitter to appoint an officer within India is quite a normal request; Twitter has no problem appointing officers in the US (who have gone so far as to ban an American president, and many of his supporters) nor does it have any problem adhering to European or Australian laws and empowering individuals working for Twitter in those countries to take such decisions. It is only India where they demand all requests from the government be sent to the US, as if they are not capable of hiring Indians to make such decisions. It is perfectly reasonable for the government to tell Twitter they need to assign local officers to deal with incoming requests. None of the other companies have an issue with this. Google agreed. Facebook agreed. I mean who wouldn't, this is a perfectly reasonable request.

And no, it was not about dissent. It was about people spreading vaccine fearmongering, and people coordinating riots such as the one on republic day, using social media. The government has no problem with you guys posting things like ""modi is useless chaiwala"", ""chowkidar chor hai"", ""surgical strikes were a jumla"", etc, on social media.

The only reason Twitter was able to create so much drama out of this situation is thanks to individuals such as yourself, and the parties you guys support. In your brain, when you see that the Modi government have a disagreement with a foreign social media company, you view it as an opportunity to attack the government regardless of the merits of the situation. Twitter knows it has useful idiots like yourself on its side, who might even go out onto the streets to protest on their behalf, which is why it can behave as if Indian laws don't apply to it.",gzuc1qu,/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/nn035c/ive_collected_all_available_records_of_upa/gzuc1qu/,3d4x4,1,1

*shows an image of the first Muslim getting lynched* under it, the day and date should be shown.

"Modi govt wanted to ban PUBG, but realised youth will then ask for jobs: Congress","The satement that pubg causes people to look away their unemployment ,falls in a logicall fallacy.There is data thar could say this but sadly data being matched dosen't mean there is a co-relation between two independent things.The year Khiladi came there was a spike in number of rapes dosen't mean Khiladi movie inspired them.

Sadly no,this isnt the truth,Taking away one form of recreation always leads to another form taking its place.Also pubg as a diversion form work and cause for unemployment is just plane wrong.Games especially games like pubg are played on good and costly hardware ,they have to be bought by some cash,this cash is either provided by family of a young one or someone buys it with their own money,the monetisation system is also based on FOMO this means game insentivises the player to spend money ,combined with the need for good internet pubg will at the minimum cost you Rs140 to play a month through the minimum expense you have to play for a 4g internet.This means the average pubg player is either taken care of by a guardian with no insentive to work or by someone who earns enought to spend on luxury.

Also ,games have been tested and researched on a lot to prove wether they cause some harm.There is a possiblity of addiction and lazyness but that is true of nearly every non-physical hobby.You can call your self a book worm and read twilight all day developing none of the skill same with games.Also game especially shooters are known to increase mental awareness,reflexes and attention to detail therefor a tool for increasing focous and skill.There is research that show games like league of legends are even more complex then games like chess.

Also ,counties that play most games are countries that are some of the richest and have least unemployment.eg-Canada,Japan even PUBG is more famous in South Korea which is one of the best countries in this regard.Also games like pubg have made kids millionars and have given rise to jobs like professional gamers and youtubers ,jobs really not possible before.

The only takeaway from this or ""truth"" from this is one failed government blaming other more failed government using thing that were not present in their time.With the ban hammer looming over every foregin app all this is giving is an escape to these stupid politicians to bann something and gain sympathy and goodwill because people find every anti-establishment and calim that appeals to data true.withouth resolving the real issues like communistic policies,excessive red tape, bad education,illetracy and lack of policies to support small bussiness , wide spread curroption ,and really personall and behavioural issues plaguing societies that stop them from taking jobs.",fziq87o,/r/india/comments/hz9umz/modi_govt_wanted_to_ban_pubg_but_realised_youth/fziq87o/,2qh1q,-1,-1

I've seen many people say that this idea was already in our mythology, which to be fair isn't different from other mythologies; but often these things turn out to be true, because the possibilities in mythology exceed in what we are currently capable of thinking.

So anyone(specially ones from previous generation) who say ""Yeh to hamare shastro me likha tha""; isn't technically wrong. THE GREEKS DO HAVE A 2 HEADED DOG THO.

Even if not ban them people themselves should understand not to buy them. Reasons you ask?


1. I hate the smell of smoke, and I don't feel like breathing just like when a smoker passes by me.


2. Many animals like dogs and cows are sensitive to loud sounds. To jo log kutto or Gau Mata ki raksha ke liye uchalte h unhe bhi ye support nhi krna chahiye. And I too don't like loud noises.

6. Now, Some people would add the point of kids. Well they obviously aren't mature enough so even if parents buy them they shouldn't buy a laaaarge amount of them, and also make them understand the real celebration of Diwali.

7. And those who are saying that firecrackers aren't harmful or aren't real reason for pollution, know the chemistry of those crackers and biology of your body.

2. Vote share of BJP in 2015 Assembly elections - 32.2. that too in the peak of Modi wave. 
Approx vote share of BJP in 2020 assembly elections - 38.43.
The vote share (and seats) actually increased. 
The Shaheen bagh vs us campaign DID work.

3. Leaders like Manish Sisodiya won by 3k votes. He was trailing since the morning. And he is second in command as well as the one who is given credit for educational reforms. This could have been a disaster. A loud phew.

4. AAP did a good amount of work but it can not be denied that freebies played an important role. Spending 1720 crores on subsidies out of 1790 crore energy budget is one of the things. How will it play out in future when there can not be any more freebies?

BBC grilling BJP spokesperson on censoring tweets criticizing the govt on covid.,"So BBC who is asking critical questions are also based outside the country. What was the point in answering those questions in this particular interview too then if every foreign criticism is to be treated with suspicion? BBC can then be said to have an agenda.

In all of this, there’s no issue of multiple voices or second-guessing (“Arey waise toh hum Modi ke against hai, lekin toilets banaane mei ya Ukraine se students waapas laane mei BJP ne achcha kaam kiya hai” isn’t the kind of stuff that makes them stop what they’re doing). There’s unity and there’s clarity and there’s never been a shortage of effort. 

No matter how vile, they have never been short of effort to earn the appeasement. Hindus on the other hand have been so complex that there’s nothing to do appease them. Kuch ko toh mandir hi nahi chahiye, kuch ko Kanhaiya’s killers se zyaada Nupur ko blame karna tha, etc.

How congress has used Mahatma gandhi for political gain?

Do you know why I like rahul more than anybody else because he acknowledge his mistake like what congress did to sikhs, rahul gandhi apologised for it even though he has nothing to do with it.

I am influenced by propaganda: ha ha ha, no man, even I disliked Rahul gandhi and thought he is not worthy and believed Modi might have changed and will do something better for India than congress did(being a muslim). My belief shattered and started observing Rahul gandhi and he started making sense in lot of issues.

The communists have successfully dealt with communal riots which is not something you can say about the bjp. The communists again have excellent rural development and education policies. 

Overall communism in India has an entirely different track record. And that history is sufficient enough to differentiate the communist party from the bjp. But you can’t be quoting the existence of communism in India to justify fascism.

"""2 Judges Can't Decide"": BJP MP's Strong Objection On Same-Sex Marriages","You aren't wrong to say that Hinduism is technically not a religion but a way of life and that some of the problematic practices we have now were corrupted by those in power.

Since Hinduism is a way of life, I consider culture, lifestyle, rituals, and dharma as Hinduism. Not just the dharma. That is because unlike Abrahamic religions we do not have an absolute text but guidelines. So, all these factors constitute the religion.

And that is also the basis for my comment.

Regardless of what original intention may have been, the practices had, at some point, intertwined with Hinduism. These faults existed long before Mughals and British came in. It was exploitable and exploited before others exploited it.

With time, we slowly separated right from wrong and will continue to do so, but not all of these problems were ""planted"" by outsiders. Given that our society had been practicing them for centuries before anyone came in, we share responsibility.

""..*but atleast Hinduism or rather the practitioners knew what was right and what was wrong to just stop practicing*""

Yes, this is also what I was saying in my previous comment when I said Hinduism *has progressed with time and with time, we will overcome what shortcomings we have.*

But people didn't just stop practicing, they applied the dharma with their times and slowly removed the bad components.

We need to do the same but a common problem I see is people assuming Hinduism to perfect and needing no change. Some just blame each and every single problem in Hinduism to the Mughals and the British. People need to accept that there were faults that we, as a society, had ourselves before anyone exacerbated it.

Pollution will be lower as they outsource the dirty industries like garments to the Bangladeshis and Indonesians and the like .
Add to it all the wealth and prosperity built by their ancestors by literary looting much of the globe 🌎.

Modi appears Hindu with rajababu style clothing at every instance to create an impression that he is a Hindu while doing shit about Hindu causes.

Imagine it takes hundred years to take back Ayodhya and now Kashi....
If it were Muslims, think how much time would it take to reclaim?

If Hindus were 10% as arseholes that communal Muslims are, Muslims would keep their heads down and mind their own business.

All my adult life, the issue always has been Hindu-Muslim and it will continue for the rest of my life because Muslims can easily be made chutiyas in the name of Islam and can made to pit against Hindus. Unless Muslims work hard to get out the cesspool they are in and get educated to come out of the ummah mindset, we will have the same story over and over.

And Islam/Christianity are predatory in nature. Hindus will have to work hard not to get their lot stolen cause numbers make the difference. Modi would happily wear a skullcap if Muslim numbers reach a significant percentage and Hindus cant bend Modi Ali even after taking him to power.

PM and his government did not even acknowledge there was a problem and also did not act on scientific advice or evidence, while ignoring rising cases.""","> you think that doing something for a person/committee is appeasement

Appeasement was a wrong word, I probably shouldn't have used. The point I was trying to make is, Congress hasn't helped minorities in our country and is only better than BJP because they haven't actively tried to kill them or drive them out of country (which is terrible by BJP and they should be punished for all the communal hatred). 

Regarding what Congress has done, I agree scholarships is a good thing, but Hajj is an appeasement in my eyes. I'm not aware how many and what scholarships BJP has stopped, but I wouldn't put it past them. Again, as long as BJP doesn't provide any special pilgrimage package for other religions, I'm okay with them cancelling Hajj.

It need not be ""us vs them"", we can have different opinions about RG's competency and credentials and completely agree that BJP has grown like a cancer and needs to be removed. Why is that a difficult concept to understand? I don't know if you understand what ""us vs them"" means, all I'm saying is I can have a different opinion from you on a particular issue, doesn't mean I'm against everything you stand for.

One more thing, Congress doesn't really follow (not anymore, at least) Gandhi, they just use his name because it helps them politically. If I'm against Congress, it doesn't mean that I support BJP. I can think critically for myself and make a decision.

And if you want proof look up cow vigilantes, or UP hate crimes. You will find the common denominator.

Also add all the other usual stuff - about how strikes are undemocratic because the govt is democratically elected and it can do whatever it wants till the next election, about how the privatisation of the banks should at least be given a chance, about how ""agar Modi ne kiya hoga to kuch soch kar hi kiya hoga"", how the Congress is behind these strikes, how it is all a conspiracy, how all the strikers are getting Rs 500 and biryani every day, where is the money for all this biryani coming from - Pakistan?, about how Shaheen Bagh Dadi has been seen with the strikers, how if these bank strikers don't like it here in India, they should go to Pakistan.

Assert confidently that there is a dark global conspiracy - the striking bankers are in cahoots with farmers, Khalistanis, Muslims, Tableeghis, spitting vegetable vendors, love jihadis, anti-Modi media, global organisations that claim India is less free now, Moody's, ISI, beef-eaters, and JNU students.",gr3lsmg,/r/india/comments/m62khd/its_aaolutely_hilarious_to_see_some_rightwing/gr3lsmg/,2qh1q,-1,2

Unpopular Opinion : Your views on Hijab are immaterial to what's happening to the girls in Karnataka,"I'll copy paste a comment I made elsewhere on this thread, about someone equating saris to burqas. Similar reasoning applies to your point (it's why I specifically mentioned controlling their entire bodies in an extremely explicit and dominant manner: i.e. total ownership).

How many women in India, Hindu and Muslim, and every other religion, eagerly look forward to buying saris? How many of them set aside some savings each year for saris? How many Muslim women would choose to wear a sari if given the option? How many women in the West wear saris when they attend Indian functions?

Now, how many Hindu women in India would choose to wear a burqa if given the option? Pray tell. How many women eagerly look forward to their yearly burqa purchase? 

The reason they are different is because the burqa is an apparent and absolute symbol of dehumanisation. The only part of you visible to the world is your eyes, maybe your face, the rest is monochrome and hidden. It is so far beyond any patriarchal vestige you associate to saris, and that is evident if you try to answer my questions above truthfully.

It says it all that people outside Indian culture are far more likely to wear saris gleefully and post pictures everywhere, than wear burqas gleefully and post pictures everywhere. 

Of course no one should be forced to wear saris. But I'd wager a lot of people would wear them with no forcing necessary. Can't say the same for burqas.",hw7uedu,/r/india/comments/so2gtj/unpopular_opinion_your_views_on_hijab_are/hw7uedu/,2qh1q,0,2

Everything is going exactly as planned to blame Diwali for pollution.,"Yes. 

It would take a beating, but it would survive. 

Hinduism survived so many barbaric invasions and colonial rules. And then fifty plus years of INC. Civilizations across the world couldn’t keep out Abrahamic invasions, but India (Hindus, Jains, Buddhists) could. Both the invading Abrahamic religions are two millennia old (at most) but there were many civilizations in the world way older than that: 

Egypt is mostly Muslim now. Latin American countries are mostly Christian now. Far-out continents like Australia have hardly any aborigines left, it’s a Christian country now. African countries are either Islamic or Christian now (places like Nigeria have so many people dying each year cos of clashes between these two religions). Parsis fled Iran too. 

Perhaps Hindus are a rare “breed” who are so resilient that we prayed to Ram and Krishna a few millennia ago and still do, despite many incidents in between which almost made us lose hope of ever retaining our people, our temples, our heritage. 

So a big thumbs down from me to you. Not because Congress is innocent but because you thought Hindus would have succumbed.

I have no problem with practices that help children keep an open mind. Hijab is not that. Watching all women if a certain age vanish into that cloth in public definitely has a negative impact on society. 

The Hijab is a symbol of discrimination. It always has been. The Harvard scholar Leila Ahmed has shown how the spread of veiling lead over time starting in the 8th century led to the ‘domestication’ of women and the curtailing of the rights they had enjoyed previously. How could it not? Women may embrace the hijab in a neo-modernist fashion to mimic the aesthetics of their faith while still being secure in the rights guaranteed them by a secular state. This is how you end up with the trad-femme anti-feminist crowd who wish to go back to the gender norms of the 60s. But they only do this secure in the knowledge that if they are abused, they can seek help. 

This is not our problem though. These decisions are up to the women to decide. Our only prerogative is to ask whether this public policy can help people. And it can and will do that.

I've collected all available records of UPA censoring free speech. Congress made 18 requests/day to Facebook and 15 requests/day to Google. That is when 70% of the country didn't even have access to the internet.,"There is a bit of problem in such situations tbh, in case of private companies censor, you have the ambit of law and the state to help, when the state decides to censure you, then you don't have much recourse. 

Just because a government was elected doesn't mean that people who voted for them agree with all their actions. Democracy is not just elections. In the present case, big tech actions ofc may be wrong in many cases, their power doesn't even match up to the power of the state which decide the policy and legal structure of a country. Take an example you choose to give away your privacy to the state, which may be similar to how an individual using Facebook decides to use it while trading his personal info. While you have made a choice on your own to trust state more than companies, remember many of us didn't. We don't want the dilution of privacy. This is different as to tech companies in which if I don't agree with their privacy policy I can leave, because if I don't agree with indian government policy, then I can't do anything because every tech platform here will follow the government policy.

The founders may have political preference and they might not change easily, but their platform doesn't equate to it. Zuckerberg views dont matter much on how a user uses whatsapp. What you are concerned about is editorial actions of platforms of censoring or removing, which is why I say reform safeharbor provisions, which provides such protection to platfroms even they are doing editorial actions. Current action is using hammer when a knife was needed.

Court orders are needed but such orders can easily be provided even for investigation phase before and if the situation went to a trial. Moreover, court order isn't needed much as a competent authority as per law can also ask for user identity. By law the competent authority is the home secretary, which basically means the home ministry or the union Government.

3. Arithmetical & Numerical Ability 20 marks

I've collected all available records of UPA censoring free speech. Congress made 18 requests/day to Facebook and 15 requests/day to Google.

At least in other countries the right wingers are the ones who are pro free speech. I guess in India we just cherry pick worst part of all ideologies huh? 

Let me try to explain the case:

Private entities should be free to control speech on their platforms however they wish. 

For eg. I should be allowed to stop you from coming to my house and shouting. 

If people don't like Twitter's rules make a new twitter or people will move. 

Free speech is freedom from the government for speech. If the country doesn't like your speech there is little choice to change countries. Further they can put you in jail for it. Something which twitter can't do. 

Free speech from the government exists to protect novel ideas good or bad from the majority. So we should never move towards FoE as determined by the government.

Lakshadweep in Trouble!,">Praful K Patel even went on to enforce the Gunda Act

on another note 

**2019 Election Officer Coercion**

On 10 April 2019 Election Commission of India issued a notice to Prafu K Patel stating that his actions violated provisions under the Representation of the People Act, 1951. The commission reprimanded Patel for having issued a ""coercive"" request to Kannan Gopinathan, the collector for Dadra and Nagar Haveli, and withdraw any notices issued to Gopinathan or any other election officials ""during the election period."" Election Commission Officials state that Praful Patel called election officers to issue them direct instructions. Crucial interference from Patel came after Gopinath sent a notice to Mohanbhai Sanjibhai Delkar for actions that violated the model code. Praful Patel retaliated by issuing a notice to Gopinath which Election Commission Officials described as an act of political vengeance.[7] Since then, Kannan Gopinathan has been replaced with Sandeep Kumar Singh as collector.

**2019 Daman Indigenous Land Clearing Protests**

Valuable seafront land along the 700 metre stretch from Moti Daman Lighthouse to Jampore beach is claimed to be owned by adivasi fishing communities who have lived there for generations as well as by NRI Damanese predominantly living in Leicester, UK. In December 2018, local residents received official looking documents purportedly instructed by Praful Patel ordering the confiscation of their land and demolition of homes to make way for development.[8] In January 2019 Praful Patel hosted a hastily arranged meeting with British MP Keith Vaz but managed to allay his fears about the case.[9] However, by November the bulldozing went ahead and the Daman protests began.

On 3 November 2019, Daman Collector Rakesh Minhas issued a Section 144 order banning peaceful assembly of four or more persons, slogan-shouting and the use of loudspeakers across the entire district and ordered the conversion of two High Schools into 'temporary jails'.[10] 70 protesters were held in these 'temporary jails' and another 8 arrests were made.[11] Few of the adivasi fisherfolk were rehoused whilst most languished traumatised and homeless on the streets near the rubble of their razed homes.[12] As of March 2021 the site is now billionaire Binod Chaudhary of CG Corp Global's The Fern Seaside Luxurious Tent Resort offering tourist accommodation for $80US/£57GBP/6000 rupees for night in a tent.[13]

**2021 suicide of Mohan Delkar**

Tribal rights advocate and Lok Sabha MP Mohanbhai Sanjibhai Delkar hanged himself at Hotel Sea Green in Mumbai on 22 February 2021 leaving a 15 page suicide note.[14] The note held politicians and administrative officials responsible for ""injustice"", ""insult"" and ""bias"" meted out to him and specifically named Praful Patel.[15]

On 5 July 2020, Delkar had posted a video on Twitter threatening to resign as Lok Sabha MP because the local administration was ""hounding him"". Then on 19 September in parliament he raised the issue of ""misbehaviour"" by local officials ""as part of a conspiracy"" claiming that on Liberation Day (2 August), he was ""denied the right to address the people of the region as an MP"".[16]

First Information Report (FIR) under Section 306 (abetment of suicide), 389 (Putting person in fear of accusation of offence, in order to commit extortion) and 506 (criminal intimidation) and sections of Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989 was filed against Praful Patel, Daman Collector Sandeep Kumar Singh, former police superintendent Sharad Darade, and few politicians including BJP leader Fatehsinh V Chauhan; who has a history of land grabbing disputes.[17] Delkar's son Abhinav has alleged that Patel threatened Delkar to pay ₹25 crore (US$3.5 million) or he would be implicated under PASA Act.[18]

**Save Lakshadweep Campaign - 2021**

Following the appointment of Praful Patel as the Administrator of Lakshadweep, a campaign against the new administrator's policies gained momentum. On 24th May 2021, #SaveLakshadweep became a trending hashtag in Twitter India.

The official twitter handle of Kerala Students Union - the Kerala wing of NSUI was suspended for a tweet against Praful Patel on 23rd May 2021[19]. The campaign was mostly against the new administrations plans to deregulate alcohol and ban beef slaughter on the island. A majority of Lakshadweep's natives belongs to the Muslim community. It was claimed by locals that the administration was implementing Hindutva agendas. There were other controversies regarding demolition of fishing structures and proposal of a new rule that prohibited parents of more than two, from contesting in local elections.",gz9yi7v,/r/india/comments/njt0f3/lakshadweep_in_trouble/gz9yi7v/,2qh1q,0,0

"Smriti Irani's son recently graduated from a foreign University. However, not a single Media house named the University.","I don’t think the Agniveer policy is targeted at youth of Middle, upper middle and upper class income groups at all. So imo that is a completely wrong argument to make here. 

I actually think the Agniveer policy is targeted more towards providing much needed temporary employment to the lower income group youth who end up getting degrees from random colleges, dont get jobs cos they lack any real skill and end up spending money on this useless degree.

Agniveer policy gives them much needed income, a lifelong set of skills and an excellent corpus upon their completion of 4 years(?) which can be used to start a solid small business (Atmanirbharta - where it is actually needed. It does not and should not concern the 0.0000000000001% population in India)

The narrative of asking people to stay in India is driven by the fact that people spend loads and loads of money to settle abroad and do low skill jobs there instead of creating jobs here when they have the money to do so.

As for the hypocrisy for sending her son out, seems like a convenient assumption that it was solely her decision to send him out. What if he was adamant to go? If you yourself could afford it, why wouldnt you do it?

I agree with you on some level that policy makers should lead by example but I think this reaction is completely unjustified.

Well, here we are. Modi is in power, the rupee is weaker than ever, petrol is more expensive than ever, and we still have border incursions.

Why? Because these things are complicated. You can't just boast about the size of your chest. It takes years of effort to fix the issues he boasted about. Modi seems to be a marketing guy, not someone terribly interested in concerted effort.

I'm happy to be United, and to support India. But as responsible citizens, it is also our job to point out the dangerous and divisive rhetoric that was used by Modi, when he was seeking power.

"The new Indian | If Trump’s supporters blame Antifa for having conspired to ‘steal’ the election from Trump, Modi’s supporters are as convinced that ‘Leftists, libtards, and Lootyens’ are behind every attempt to criticise Modi’s government and his policies","Trump supporters get all their information from an incredibly airtight right wing echo chamber that is completely and utterly separated from the mainstream news. The two spheres are light years apart. Trump supporters do not trust mainstream news outlets in the USA. They think the mainstream media is peddling lies and falsehoods, because they are all out to get Trump and destroy America. This is why Trump supporters are able to believe that the rioters were antifa. Trump said so, and Trump's word is law, and the mainstream media, as well as the FBI, and multiple law enforcement agencies in the govt, are lying liars who lie.

This is not exactly the case in India. When Modi first got elected in 2014, right wing misinformation became mainstreamed in India in a way that hasn't happened in the USA. Republic TV is the biggest news channel in India. Remember how they spent months over the summer shrieking about Rhea Chakraborty and Sushant Singh Rajput. Vast segments of the population get their information from WhatsApp forwards, which the right wing has hijacked to spread their lies to a science. And there are very few progressive media outlets in India that are capable of combating the mainstream giants. The majority of them spend their time enabling Modi. Print media outlets have not been all that effective on this front either, and the few that do (Caravan, Wire, Scroll, etc.) are not widely read to really make much of a difference.

The problem is much worse in India. The marked increase of privately owned media outlets, particularly news channels, happened around the same time as Modi got elected. And 24/7 news channels are how a lot of Indians digest their information today. They have played a huge role in mainstreaming unquestioning support for Modi, and suppressing all criticism of him. To use the comparison to America, it would be as if the whole country thought Fox News was actually decent and factual, and channels like Newsmax and OAN are respectable right wing avenues for getting factual information, rather than batshit insane conspiracy theory peddling shit shows. That's where India is right now with Republic TV, TimesNow etc., which are polluting our media landscape and melting the brains of its viewers.",gir3lkb,/r/india/comments/ku5i9f/the_new_indian_if_trumps_supporters_blame_antifa/gir3lkb/,2qh1q,-1,-1

Priorities of respective governments,I'm quite apolitical. But it isn't so black and white. For example. About 2 years ago one of my society's security guards meekly came up to our apartment and asked for money because he needed 30k for a surgery. He was going around people's houses who knew him well and seeking any help or donation. We told him about the pm Ayushman something scheme where the govt covers part of their healthcare for free. Except we came to know mamata never allowed it to implement in WB(where we live) because of her spite for Modi/BJP . And now that elections are coming she's recently finally announced her version of the same thing. Now people like these guards and poor may or may not be right wing. Who cares. But what's the message that they are getting you can imagine. At some level some people are benefitting. But some politicians would dare not allow poor people better healthcare because it would give other party a talking point. And this is just one scheme.,gl33ta7,/r/india/comments/l6t78h/priorities_of_respective_governments/gl33ta7/,2qh1q,1,-1

Assam Detention Camp located in Goalpara district, Assam, is India's first (and largest) Internment Camp for illegal immigrants. The detention center will cover approximately 2,88,000 square feet and will include a school, recreational area and hospital. The center has been sanctioned by the Union Home Ministry in June 2018, which is funding the entire project.It is the first of the many in-construction or proposed detention centres to be constructed following the exclusion of people from the final National Register of Citizens of India. In 2014, the Centre had told all the states to set up at least one detention centre for illegal immigrants so as not to mix them up with jail inmates.

Yesterday the government said there is no soldier of Indian army missing & today the Chinese gov released 10 Indian army soldiers. If the Chinese had not released them we would have never known about them. Indian government literally disowned our own soldier. This is what is call Anti-National.,"Military is in a way complicit as well. 

The whole Pakistan strike escalation in run up to GE2019 is part of this. The Govt till Oct-Nov 2018 was not having a good time and polling showed it. Post that border issue, it was basically over. 

Military has to show some spine as well. Even the China situation fundamentally is a Political problem between India and China due to border not being Politically Ratified. Military is a sideshow in this. 

We've seen this over and over again the world over. Militaries are Fighting forces, they are not supposed to do *Management*, be it Bureaucratic or those having Political angles. This is a huge reason US gets bogged down in Wars despite having the most powerful Military to have existed in this Planet's history. Yet those coups they orchestrate pay off better for them because right tools right objective. Done and dusted, move on. 

Indian Military time and again has said about India China border, that due to differing perceptions of border issues arise. Well Military can't solve this and management isn't what they should be doing, certainly not for 50 years and counting. This is how resources (human and capital) get strained. 

Military can't disobey the elected Govt, fair enough, but if they let themselves get used like this, the rot was there as well. And I've seen this slow politicisation of military in last 10-15 years happen. Too many former or retired officers being too political in public.

The above is my position.

A person that is ""not"" proud of their nazi ancestor will not identify themselves as nazi-german or nazi-jewish mixed-heritage individual. A 3rd generation descendent of KKK member who is born to black & white parents (mixed race), will not identify the ""KKK"" aspect of their ancestry.

The very fact that a person ""chooses"" to ""identify"" themselves with particular aspects of their ancestry (such as nazi, or KKK, or other invasive species) is of & by itself evidence that they ""value"" that part of their ancestry. And a modern day german who values their nazi ancestry, or a modern day white person who values their KKK ancestry, is being racist (in doing so).

Protesters have gathered outside Gateway if India since morning to condemn the violence at JNU. We want freedom from this fascist government,"Well... The fact is that there are 2 different phenomena here.

Painful throat vs losing ones voice. (sore vs hoarse)

Both can occur at the same time or separately. There are different words in the language to convey these separate ideas.

Here are definitions from Google...

Hoarse : (of a person's voice) sounding rough and harsh, typically as the result of a sore throat or of shouting.

Sore : (of a part of one's body) painful or aching.

I would suggest that people using these words as synonyms are doing it incorrectly... But the recent trend is to say ""if people are doing it, that is now the correct usage and the modern definition"".

If the people using it incorrectly have their way, both the words will soon mean the same and we will have to provide extra information to differentiate between the 2 concepts.

CM Kejriwal has a genius idea to boost the Nation's Economy,"For one thing, he's wrong when he considered Gandhi a politician par excellence,

To quote ""Gandhi believed that politics had to be guided by religion which treats all beings as equal and removes excessive greed from life. To many today, deeply sucked into comfort-seeking lifestyles, Gandhi may look impractical and too naïve for the complicated ‘modern’ world. But no one, not even his worst enemies, would deny that he was a “simple soul”, yet a gritty one, who became a powerful weapon to make colonialism history."" 

I try to be one of the few people who don't want to see Gandhi as a politician or a Mahatma
To quote Guha

""Gandhi is impossible to classify in terms of conventional political categories. Was he a socialist, conservative, liberal or all of these? He was a true original. The left came to a belated recognition of the moral greatness of Gandhi, especially because of what he did for Hindu-Muslim harmony. For a long time, the left claimed that non-violence was a devious way to wean the masses away from the revolutionary path, but its attitude changed after what Gandhi did in 1947 for communal harmony. The right essentially dislikes Gandhi. It is profoundly ambivalent about him but instrumentally knows it cannot reject him outright. So it tries to make him more of a Hindu, assimilate him into a line of Hindu saints, but anyone on social media would know the Hindu right detests Gandhi.""


And also for the genocide thing, Gandhi was with the Khilafat movement and when the genocide happened, he termed the moplaphs as 'misguided and ignorant' not because of any political leanings but because in Greek philosophy, namely Socrates, All good is knowledge and all evil is ignorant; the same goes with the concept of Maya in Advaita Vedanta",itx572c,/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/ydqq7s/cm_kejriwal_has_a_genius_idea_to_boost_the/itx572c/,3d4x4,-1,-2

They are attending AAP party rally in Gujarat but don’t even know who Kejriwal is… Paise dekar bheed ikhata ho sakta hain par sach to nikal jaayega. Video Courtesy BBC,"So I'll give you a basic info about why they are there. From their surname, Parmar, I can understand that they belong to the Vankar category which comes under SC - \*which I belong to too\*. 

Most Vankars were college educated but without jobs. Post Nationalisation of Banks in India in 1969, they were able to acquire jobs in the 14 banks that got nationalised then. Ever since then, they have been voting for Congress, as they were able to afford a better life. In the past 20 years since Modi, the relevance of Congress has diminished in Gujarat, and most SCs have been fed much hatred against BJP by the elders, who I believe might have reason to hate him. 

The caste discrimination in Gujarat was high back in the time, not that it is not present now, it still is, but in a lesser intensity. Then when a person from the SC community is disallowed for eg. riding a horse for his wedding, or keeping a moustache, which are thought of as upper caste things by upper caste people, and then there's little to no action on the perpetrators, the anger against administration and the ruling party boils up. 

Now since Congress is irrelevant in Gujarat, the only alternative is AAP. As with every rally, people are brought (read bought) in hordes from villages to show strength. Who is the leader is irrelevant; they know the party symbol, and they press the button. 

The newer generation of educated SCs vote for BJP as they know how things have changed and keep themselves updated on the ongoings. But that's a minority. Most SC stay in villages, but they still do not make up enough to oust BJP from power, hence there's not much of a threat.",ivnk59r,/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/yponl2/they_are_attending_aap_party_rally_in_gujarat_but/ivnk59r/,3d4x4,2,1

Unpopular Opinion : Your views on Hijab are immaterial to what's happening to the girls in Karnataka,"What people don't want to say is that all these things are happening to rile minorities up and bait them to protest. Once they start voicing their rights, it will be easier for propagandist media to brand them and their faith as regressive, anti-national and unfit to live in india. 

Also, women is any community are associated with that community's dignity and self-respect. That's why women have always been targeted by fringes to irk a community. To rile up a majority community, they show that women of that community are being mistreated by minorities. And similarly they try to agitate minorities by showing their women being targeted by a majority community. This has been a *modus operandi* of fringes for ages; women have been commoditized for hate and propaganda.

People don't want to acknowledge this but a majority of india has lost its critical thinking ability and is just going the way propaganda tells them to. It becomes easier for political partie to go to these people and declare that minorities are a threat to the country's culture. Talk to some brain-washed extremist person in small towns or rural india, they often say that, ""We are ready. We are waiting for *them* to do something so that we can react and retaliate. We can do anything for our religion and country."" Majority communities have been made to commit horrible crimes by political parties by just packaging hate in the form of fictitious threat.

Do you think those school going children really care about about uniform civil code? How does girls not wearing a hijab even help those school going boys? Two weeks ago these kids were preparing for competitive exams. Think about it.This sudden flare up could only be a result of external political influence to disturb communal harmony and also to divert attention from the on-going parliament sessions.

Lakshadweep in Trouble!,"Stop eating plants?

Don't you know plants can't feel pain, die to the fact that they lack a central nervous system? Can't listen?

If you believe plants feel pain, since you're so worried about plants, Also more plants are killed to feed animals than humans, i.e. a meat eater results in the death of more plants than a plant eater. Meat manufacturing is not an resource efficient process. The plants are grown, then killed, fed to animals, animals process into turds, get fatter, then the animal is killed. If you're a meat eater, you result in the pain and suffering of both the animal and also the plants.

Another low for Punjab. Shiv Sena leader shot dead in front of Police.

In India at least, they are under our control, if they go beyond their limits, the police will take action against them, and the desire for Khalistan isn't as prominent. In Canada and UK, they can do whatever they please, abuse India as much as they want and they can use their newfound increased wealth to back and fund anti national elements.

Then, ramp up security and intelligence operations in Punjab, raise Hindu and moderate Sikh voices and arrest anyone trying to spread dissent. Educate the Sikh populace on the shared history between Sikhs and Hindus and their common origins.

I grew up studying in Tirunelveli which has 20% Christian population. I don't need a twitter handle to tell me what's going on in the places I grew up.

1. Conversion is rampant here amongst the Dalit community, but that is more so of a political/social movement that these pastors. Many Dalits claim they have converted to Christianity, remain Hindu on paper and even retain hindu practises like worshipping the local goddess.
2. Next method of conversion - conversion for hospital/school/college discounts + promise of job is also very common. No one converts for free food, the offer has to be quite worthy. This is operated through Christian hospitals/schools/social service/business.

3)Amongst the manipulative methods, the prayer method is common. Here the pastors do not perform public healing, but go in search of patients and tell them to pray to jesus to see if he hears their prayers. Remember, normal treatment is NOT discontinued here. Patients are in fact, strongly encouraged to continue their treatment.

As with serious medical cases, 20-30% of people do heal. When these people heal, these people approach the family and say Jesus has heard your prayers, so now convert if you have an inch of gratitude towards Jesus.

Why do they do that? Well, they are paid in Bajra not money, and they cannot afford anything else. 

Our own govt data shows that 60% of kids under the age of 5 are underweight, and out of those 60% kids, 90% and more are from villages only, and 40% from UP & Bihar combined.
The developing area in our country is the south where people are fed, infants are fed, yea they are not living like a GREAT life, but they are well enough.

But hey, 45% of our population lives in UP, BIHAR & WB, so yea, we are underdeveloped. If after 75 years of independence and 33% budget allocation to rural development, if farmers does suicides (which is hidden by the govt after 2019 because those cases reached 3000 or so), kids are not fed, or someone is beated to death because of drinking well water (5000 something case in this year of violence against low caste) and then fool populace is worried about Muslim rhetoric (400th case of Muslim injuring Hindus), then that is maybe one more reason to be under developed.

Yes.

Yes.

Yes. Yes, its even easier now with quicker dispensation of propaganda and misinformation. Yes.

The details of holocaust started to come to light only after Germany's defeat in 1945. Throughout the world war, Germany maintained that the concentration camps only to provide labour needed to fuel the war machinery, and Jews are safe. Strong propaganda and disinformation machinery is the root of all facist regime.

No one actually believed Holocaust was taking place during world war, hell many don't believe it ever happened even today. Nazis were not the clear symbol of evil, they are now. They were the symbol of German Nationalism and Aryan pride (Sounds similar?). History is fuzzy in the making, and only _clearer_ in the hindsight.

If anything its much easier to divide and conquer India, due to its diversity, our differences and the ingrained DNA that makes a typical Indian wanting to best for himself, and not the general population. Also, you seem to have a lot of faith in India's law and order. I'd argue its misplaced.

Our school actively discouraged tutions. They even started doing extra classes so that students wouldn't go to tutions. They also told students they can come to teachers to ask doubts after classes. They even had personal sessions with students who attended tutions to ask what school could do to stop thrm from going there.

Our school even had a ""teachers diary"" which was written by students which had all that was done by teacher in class. Before recruiting teachers there were demos. Many teachers weren't recruited. I've had life changing teachers in that school. 

My physics teacher ah the dude who made my base in phy crystal fucking clear. Taught us how politics aren't right or wrong. They are all wrong. Taught us truths of life. Taught us how to cheat in exams. Taught us to trust parents more than anyone else.

My Comp teacher who'd take extra extra classes even after extra classes to teach me stuff out of syllabus cause I had the ""janoon.""

My english teacher. Man... she was literally one of the best fucking teachers.

My Punjabi teachers. No words they were amazing.

Chem teachers nice.

Literature teacher is fucking God. The chapters he told us to study came in exams.

Plus I am not sur ebut I think our school incentivised teachers to get the best results. The teachers who had best results would get bonus.(That's just a rumor I got from friend of friend so take it with a pinch of salt)

And as usual, nothing to be happy about for the middle class.

Hates religion and respects all genders

This is exactly me as well. Except that I am a practicing Sikh and not atheist. 

Personally, I hate both parties a lot. To me, it seems like people on this sub are thinking that getting Rahul Gandhi as PM is going to solve most problems (as long as he replaces Modi). The answer is NO. It will only solve half the problems but the Congress will bring new problems for the country. Rahul Gandhi is not some saviour. People only think that the country has become worse in only last 6 years despite the fact that the country has seen many ups and downs throughout the years. Situation was also bad in 1947-48, 1975-77, 1984-89, 1997-99, 2011- present.

I'll be honest, BJP is doing things that Congress has already done in the past.

Genocides- ✅
Divisive Politics - ✅
Corruption - ✅
Oppression on Minorities - ✅
Curbs on Opposition - ✅
Lack of Transparency - ✅
Misusing Judiciary - ✅
Provocative Statements - ✅
Kashmir - ✅

The only thing that BJP still hasn't done are :-

Fascism - ❌ (Emergency)

Editing the Preamble - ❌ (Indira edited the Preamble during the Emergency Period)

Nepotism - ❌

I can only see BJP becoming another version of Congress. It's ministers are arrogant, Prime Minister is completely out of touch with the realities on the ground. 

Unfortunately, people on this sub are completely out of touch with the reality. This happened in 2019 as well where many were actually predicting a BJP loss. Either they will support the farmers (who are protesting against BJP) and at the same time, call them ignorant and dumb just because many of them vote for BJP. Nobody has talked to people in the villages and ask them why they vote for their party. I've seen people on this sub calling all BJP supporters as stupid, anti-Muslim and bigots despite the fact that BJP voters are equal to almost 40% of India's adult population. 

You can't just call that many people stupid just because you don't like them voting for a particular party. A lot of them are centrists as well. You need to understand their reasons for voting for BJP and tell them why they are wrong. You can't just call them stupid first and expect that people are going to vote for the left.

Both Right-Wing and Left-Wing thrive on hate and negativity. BJP is absolutely horrible but so is Congress. I hope, people on this sub realise that quickly.",g7zpk3p,/r/india/comments/j6i5yf/ani_do_you_know_why_china_was_able_to_take_away_a/g7zpk3p/,2qh1q,0,-1

"An attempt to address the list of ""simplified"" explanation that is floating around in an attempt to justify the Citizenship Amendment Fact","I'll try to answer your questions, although I am certainly not an expert, and this is mostly just Wikipedia-knowledge. Also I haven't seen the RSTV video you linked -- it's 28 mins long!

All Ahmadis did not go to Pakistan, many chose to remain in India, where they are considered Muslims by law. Those that did go to Pakistan went for three reasons:

1. the author of the Lahore Resolution that states Muslim-majority regions should be independent, was Muhammad Zafarullah Khan, a president of Int'l Court of Justice, whose father was a companion of the founder of the Ahmadiyya movement;
2. the successor of Ahmad, the founder, told his followers to support the Muslim League and (through the cleric of the Ahmadiyya community in England) made Jinnah agree to return to India;
3. the Ahmadis were allowed to found a city, Rabwah, in Punjab, Pakistan, in 1948.

These reasons gave the Ahmadis a false sense of security in Pakistan, but the religious persecution soon started, with an anti-Ahmadi riot as early as in 1953. So, in short, the Muslim League pretended to represent them ('cause religion) but all they wanted was support. Once they got that, they fucked them over.

&#x200B;

Articles 14 ~~and 15~~ gives any person (not just Indian citizens) equality before the law ~~and protection from discrimination based on religion etc., respectively~~. Both of them are in Part III of the Constitution, which are *Fundamental Rights*. **Any** law the Government/Parliament makes is subject to Fundamental Rights, and as such any law discriminating based on religion (as CAA explicitly does) is *void* (Article 13(2)). So CAA is unconstitutional.

&#x200B;

Any oppressed people, be it Palestinians, Kurds, or even Indians during the Raj, have radical elements prone to violence (think Bhagat Singh, Khudiram Bose or Aurobindo Ghose), which both results from and is directed towards the oppressor. Once the oppression ends, so do the radical activities. The radical Mukti Bahini of Bangladesh stopped its activities only after they gained independence from Pakistan, in which India played a big role. As the most powerful country in South Asia, we have a responsibility to preserve the peace in our region. This can only be done by liberating the Rohingya, and with our help they will stop their radical acts, just like Indian freedom fighters or the Mukti Bahini.

[Payal Mehta] Violence caught on cctv said to be attack on a BJP workers home in Kasba,">lynchings closer to home

which are totally law and order problems and have nothing to do with religion

""intolerance"" in a country where Madarsas brainwash children to hate idol worshipping polytheistic pagans (Koran 9:5, 9:29, 3:28, 4:11, 21:98 and other similar verses) and government funds these 'religious institutions'

""secularism"" in a country where non- muslims cannot manage mosques and non- christians can't manage churches but for Hindus:

**Our Temples do not belong to us.** In most of the states, Governments have passed acts and legislations to take over Hindu institutions including Temples, Mutts and Endowments. This has enabled the Government to interfere in the Temples’ management, practices and rituals. Not just that, Temples’ properties and income have also been usurped by the Government. The most outrageous fact is that the Government exerts such a control exclusively on the Hindu Temples; the places of worship of other religions enjoy freedom and autonomy. This is a clear-cut case of systematic discrimination and harassment.

From education to ecology and culture to charity, Hindu Temples have played a pivotal role in shaping the Indian society. Today’s India has become a battleground for the clash of civilizations, and the Hindu society is facing an existential threat. The need to revive the Temple eco-system is more important than ever. But this cannot be achieved without freeing them from the clutches of the State.

The Government’s control over the Hindu Temples is unconstitutional and immoral. Hindu Temples belong to the Hindu society and the State must exit immediately.

While the state governments control over 4 lakh out of an estimated 9 lakh temples across the country, there is no such control over Muslim and Christian religious bodies. In this backdrop, there are demands to amend “The Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments (HRCE) Act 1951”, which allows the state governments to take over temples and maintain complete control over them and their properties.

There are over 15 state governments which control only Hindu religious institutions, specifically temples—right from the appointment of administrators to mandatory collection of 13-18% service charge. This takes away the community’s right and resources to protect its interests. This, according to them, is discriminatory as only Hindu community suffers this kind of treatment. It violates the concept of secularism. Also, the Indian Constitution does not permit the State to run religious institutions.

Those advocating for equality say that the process of taking control of temple riches was started by the Mughals and was followed by the British rulers. After Independence, the Jawaharlal Nehru government continued with the policy of controlling the temples by enacting the HRCE Act in 1951. “To the contrary, there is no such control over mosques and churches. We demand that in the same way, temples should also be freed from any kind of control. The government must amend the Act, which is the root cause of the problem,” said J. Sai Deepak, noted Supreme Court lawyer. He also pointed out that traditionally also the “Raja” (king) does not have the right over the wealth of the temple.

*How could Indian courts recognise Sharia-based Muslim Personal Law while claiming to be secular? How could Central and State governments take over the management of Hindu temples if they were secular? How could a secular government provide financial assistance to educational institutions run by religious organisations? How could a secular government codify and modify Hindu personal law? How would the government extend the existing caste-based reservations to minority religions if it were secular?*",gwqvmer,/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/n3fvao/payal_mehta_violence_caught_on_cctv_said_to_be/gwqvmer/,3d4x4,1,2

"Smriti Irani's son recently graduated from a foreign University. However, not a single Media house named the University.","Mostly because we massively overload them. While underfunding them. Delhi University has an undergrad intake of tens of thousands of students. Master's intakes of hundreds. Meanwhile there have been no permanent faculty hires in years, so now a majority of the lecturing is being done by Ad-Hocs and Guest Lecturers who are basically PhDs and early career scholars who cannot grow in their fields because there is no job security and shit pay.

And why is that? Because we neither support our unis, nor give them autonomy. They have regularly faced budget cuts, even as the government makes them take more and mroe students (usually with each reservation reform) because the brand value and demand for higher education is high. So they bow down to public pressure and arbitrarily increase seats. Meanwhile everyone wants to get in, and nobody likes being left out, so the application sizes are enormous. And the government rather than trusting them to select for themselves, imposes arbitrary central exams usually poorly designed. And with shit primary education, too many students getting in don't have basic skills so the colleges also need to focus on improving their language and reasoning abilities.

Fact is we're simply asking too much of them and just not paying them enough. DU should honestly be half a dozen university instead of the super organization that it is incapable of functioning effectively because of its massive size. And we just need more universities. There are more good universities in a single US state than there are in the entirety of India.

Unfortunately that requires the government to do something it hates.

1. Give more money
2. Give autonomy. Help the institutions build up, but stop imposing insane bureaucratic rules on them that destroy research capacity.

Instead for the last 3 decades we've done the opposite. Fixing it would be a generational effort. Not gonna happen in a few years. And I'm not sure if we, as a people, have any sort of patience for it.

We also need to fix our primary education, but that's not my primary area, so I don't have as much specific info for that.",ihjmlyi,/r/india/comments/w7co36/smriti_iranis_son_recently_graduated_from_a/ihjmlyi/,2qh1q,0,0

"An attempt to address the list of ""simplified"" explanation that is floating around in an attempt to justify the Citizenship Amendment Fact","I found this statement the most surprising so i googled around a bit myself. 

From my understanding(i could be wrong) what this statement essentially says, before now India would have zero refugees as we dont have to accept any as we are not party to any Convention or Protocol. Simple searches shows that India has freely accepted refugees from both Tibet and Sri Lanka. 

So saying that Muslims from 3 countries(or for that matter any person from any other country) would not legally be able to get refugee status and then sub-sequently be able to apply for Indian Citizenship is incorrect.

Also from the page of the Indian National Bar Association([https://www.indianbarassociation.org/indias-refugee-policy/](https://www.indianbarassociation.org/indias-refugee-policy/))

>Even though India is not a signatory to the 1951 Convention on refugees and also the 1967 Protocol, it is a signatory to a number of United Nations and World Conventions on Human Rights, refugee issues and related matters. Hence its obligations in regard to refugees arise out of the latter. India has also voted affirmatively to adopt the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which affirms rights for all persons, citizens and non- citizens a like.
