"Smriti Irani's son recently graduated from a foreign University. However, not a single Media house named the University.","Well, the thing about the future is that it's unpredictable. Road accidents are very common in foreign countries. Suppose the person who took a loan to study got involved in one. They are fucked right. They'll be in a mountain of debt with no way to repay it. But a rich person wouldn't be in a life ruining situation then. That's my reasoning why foreign education is limited to rich people. 

Besides, a household earning 3lpa is already in the top 10% of Indians. And it's impossible to go abroad with 3lpa. So foreign education is not accessible for 90% of Indians. My point stands.

Ambarsar was already being held captive in 1970 and India could have lost the Punjab state. She crushed that insurgency before it could ever peak; she didn't even let their supposed rebellion against the state start, taking out the face of the movement in the beginning, which is why the khalistani movement's majority has only been attacking unarmed Punjabi Hindus.

"An attempt to address the list of ""simplified"" explanation that is floating around in an attempt to justify the Citizenship Amendment Fact","This post has several factual errors that I cannot even start pointing out. 

I request everybody to do their own research.

India is a country were millions of parsi's from Iran migrated (12-20th century), millions from afganistan (during their struggle with russia), from sri lanka, from bangladesh, from Tibet (China) and now from Burma. 

Do you know that most number of migrants come to India from Bangladesh and Pakistan? 

Please read the Citizenship act of 1955. It clearly says who is an illegal immigrant. Any body who is in India without a valid passport is illegal. This new bill excludes the people in the 6 communities from being illegal. All Illegal immigrants should be deported. Now, every country has the right to decide who can migrate. For example, US has EB5 visa to stop poor people from coming in, other countries have point system based on education/age, then there is something called 'extreme vetting' for people from select countries. If India decides to relax immigration rules for minorities of these three countries, it is not discriminatory but a preference. These three countries are not secular countries. These are Islamic countries where Minorities are killed. There is no question about it. 

Did you know that in Assam, there are more refugees than assamees? Have you read about Assam Agitation? 

At this point, people who are protesting and throwing stones and burning buses, should educate themselves. Being secular does not mean you should illegal immigration.

It is easy to brand me a bhakt, or someone from quora or whatever...but educate yourself about our history...you do not have to go back several years...only upto 1947.",fbfc3c4,/r/india/comments/ebdeup/an_attempt_to_address_the_list_of_simplified/fbfc3c4/,2qh1q,2,2

Just got abused on the train by a hyper-nationalist woman for a really absurd reason.,"If you don't have any experience, then don't engage, but if you really wanna, learn to disagree by agreeing first. People have this image that genz/millennials are kinda edgy. To counter this stereotype, agree with other's opinions first, and show them how learnt you're in their own field. For example, in the above case, you could've told her that we were good and formulated a lot of mathematics and Ayurveda was one of the best of that time.

Now once you've got her to agree with you, now it's your time to convince her that she's wrong. You've just destroyed that edgy teen stereotype by pleasing her with facts.To do further damage reduction, talk about hinduism and show her you're more well versed with Hinduism than her. This is not only to woo her, but the public too, so that either they don't interfere or bash you. Don't bring out that you're atheist or anything.

Now to prove them wrong, you could've said that now the times have changed. Remember, you could've said that right at the beginning but that wouldn't have worked. It'll now because she's more vulnerable. You don't have to make other person feel guilty or inferior or anything, you just have to make them realize that they're wrong. One thing that people agree with most of the times is how talking about past wouldn't bring a change in the future, and how development makes other nations respect us, our opinions and our culture more.

Now you've to properly gauge when to turn the wheels. Some people can be just hopeless and nothing you say will have any effect. In such situations, politely disengage ( do something impolite and they'll bring the duel right at your door. Also don't do any of the young vs old shit, that will feed to edgy teen stereotype and public will get swayed towards the opponent.)",hoqa7dm,/r/india/comments/rh2kcs/just_got_abused_on_the_train_by_a/hoqa7dm/,2qh1q,-1,-1

When Indira Gandhi cracked down on BBC,"How can someone actually in their right frame of mind equate Indira regime's emergency to a mere banning of a propaganda laden documentary.

During Indira's emergency along with taking away press freedom there was a crackdown on trade unions as well. The Indira government reportedly banned trade union activity, strikes by workers and imposed fixed wages with no scope for bonuses. The workers that protested against this faced strict repression. Another controversial aspect of this period was Sanjay Gandhi’s mass sterilization program across the country and demolitions of slums for ‘beautification’ of cities with little to no prior notice to slum dwellers.

The most jarring aspect of Indira's emergency was Constitutional rights of people of India were suspended. Right to approach court for enforcement of Fundamental rights was taken away. Several of Gandhi’s political opponents were imprisoned including LK Advani, Atal Bihar Vajpayee, Morarji Desai and JP Narayan. A mass sterilisation programme was also enacted by Sanjay Gandhi. All powers were vested in the hands of the Union government. This all went on for 21 months. 

When BJP and Modi remind people of dark days of emergency, it's the culmination of all these draconian acts which took place when emergency was declared. 

Modi ever since 2014 has never suspended your right to approach the Supreme Court or a High Court for enforcement of your fundamental rights. There has been no curtailment of press freedom. Malicious channels like NDTV, Quint, The Wire have regularly peddled propaganda and post Adani takeover sepoys like Rubbish who are on payroll of Congress have flocked to Youtube. 

IT dept has statutory right to conduct raids. They don't have to wait for the cover of emergency to conduct raids on suspicious bodies. These BBC are habitual offenders in tax evasion. Acc to a 2012 report, thousands of public employees, including those at the BBC, were not paying their taxes at the source. Report was by public accounts committee in the United Kingdom (UK). In 2016, HM Revenue and Customs had reportedly begun an investigation into more than 100 BBC broadcasters amid allegations that they had underpaid their income tax and National Insurance contributions.

Just got abused on the train by a hyper-nationalist woman for a really absurd reason.,"Once was on a bus

And there was this lady approx 50 sitting next to me. She was pretty talkative with people around. Later on a muslim couple (because the male had that muslim cap and woman was wearing hijab) boarded the bus and sat somewhere in front way ahead of us.

As soon as they entered she began talking about Muslims and was like Hell lot of Islamophobic she literally went on to say ""all Muslims should be gathered around and killed with a bomb"" And this is problematic ofc but tbh I was tired af to even start an argument with her or to even disagree. 

But I wanted her to stop. So till this point she had no idea of my own identity. When she was going on with all of her shitty and problematic opinions about people of a religion. I pretended someone was calling me and I asked her to be quite for a second because I need to pick this up, I pretended to pick the call and answer with ""aslam e walaikum janab, hum raaste me hai aur aap se pohnch kar baat karte hai"" Translation: ""aslam e walaikum janab, I am on my way and would talk as soon as I reach"" 

Now it seemed to her like I was a Muslim and the rest of the journey she didn't even utter a word and was embarrassed af plus I didn't wanna get bothered again by starting a convo with her.",hor1py0,/r/india/comments/rh2kcs/just_got_abused_on_the_train_by_a/hor1py0/,2qh1q,-2,-2

May 16th: “Shame on Govt for sending vaccines abroad”. June 1st: “Shame on Govt for not sending vaccines abroad”. Is this a joke? Dirty politicising of the Pandemic by the Congress perfectly captured by 3 Shashi Tharoor tweets.,"Let's be logical.

India's first batch of vaccines was ordered in January. The number of doses: Mere 15 million. To let you know we have a population of 1+ billion. Hence, more than 2 billion doses are required.

Poonawalla never thought he would require a billion + doses. What's implicit here? You're smart enough - hopefully - to infer that.

The second batch was ordered as late as 28 April.

You do realize that the second wave was raging at this time?

Yes, and it was anticipated. Almost no country has managed to escape the wrath of successive waves!

By comparison, many countries - even by PPP standard - have invested tons of cash in R&D whereas SII and BB, and others were left at their own mercies.

\*Not to mention we have NOT imported a SINGLE vax\*. The US by comparison has hoarded 300 million doses of AZ even after having more than sufficient stock to inoculated its citizens multiple times. Other countries are capable of inoculating their citizens MULTIPLE times.

India was, indeed, capable. Someone's mismanagement DOESN'T make my country any less capable.

So, Modi need not have to snap to make billions of doses come out of his ass.

"An attempt to address the list of ""simplified"" explanation that is floating around in an attempt to justify the Citizenship Amendment Fact","> From what I can see as of now it discriminates muslims from outside India (especially the Rohingyas). 

**It discriminates against ALL muslims (persecuted or not) from anywhere.** 

- The NRC and CAA are two sides of the same coin when it comes to citizenship.

- **The NRC is ""exclusionary"" in nature** - it's job is to identify the illegal immigrants to India and **strip them of any indian citizenship** as they are foreigners illegally in India.

- **The CAA is ""inclusive"" in nature** - it's job is to **grant indian citizenship to some** of these illegal foreigners stripped of citizenship by NRC, based only on their religion (targeted mainly at Hindus) and ""persecution"" status in three neighbouring muslim countries (Pak, Af, Bangla). 

- **The end result of NRC + CAA is that ALL muslims**, and some Hindus and Christians etc. **will end up in refugee camps**. But due to the stupid illogical selective criteria most of the non-muslim refugees from Pak, Af, Bangla will get citizenship only because they were ""lucky"" to be born as non-muslims in these country, while muslims and non-muslims from other countries will continue to suffer.

> I feel there is some merit to the point that giving citizenship to Muslims from Bangladesh Pakistan is not needed ... But please dont just say India is secular and it discriminates).

**Yes, India is secular. Yes, CAA discriminates. That is a fact.** CAA is highly discriminatory to ""other"" persecuted victims from the non-muslim countries. There is no reason to treat a (for e.g.) Hindu foreigner from a muslim country as more special than a Hindu foreigner from a Hindu or Buddhist country. It is just plain ridiculous - **they are all foreigners and the victims or the persecutors religion doesn't make them special in anyway**. 

**The persecuted are the persecuted. They all feel the same pain, fear, anger and hatred. They are all victims of some kind of identity politics. It is totally inhuman to subject them to even more identity politics in the one place they found some sanctuary and a bit of peace and hope. They are all same and deserve to be treated fairly.**

> Also, from what I can see, as of now the Indian Muslims are safe. 

This is not true - **if an Indian muslim**, like most of the undocumented poor or those whose documents have been missing or damaged due to a natural calamity, **is unable to produce any document to prove his citizenship then that muslim will face detention and possible forceful deportation** to some foreign muslim country according to the whims of the government.

A Hindu without document can still lie and say he is persecuted immigrant from Pak, Af or Bang and ask citizenship. A muslim will have no recourse. 

> Just saying secular and discrimination and Indian constitution is not an educated argument. 

Lol. Then what is? Someone's ""feelings"" on the matter? That is exactly what this is about - Do you believe and accept the constitution of India? Do you believe in secularism that says nobody should be treated differently because of their religion? Do you believe India should be a Hindu Rashtra with special rights only for Hindus?

That is not how GST works. GST is collected in producer states, and then split between producer and consumer state. This is by design because if we don't do it, states are going to start imposing cess/taxes on interstate trade breaking down federalism.

Congress and Ayodhya,"You said it yourself - an atheist leader that is defined by their atheism. The suppression of the Uyghurs by the CCP can be put down to Han Chinese supremacy or communism, but not atheism.

Stalin's purges, the Khmer Rouge, atrocities in North Korea - you can classify these all as Stalinism, Juche, Pol Pot-ism (is that a thing?) or whatever. That they happened in countries with atheist regimes is entirely incidental.

The Holocaust is also a pretty good example. There was industrial scale murder of Jews, Slavs (predominantly Eastern Orthodox) and communists. (mainly atheist) But the Third Reich is not remembered as a fundamentalist Catholic state, rather a fascist one.

> Facebook Inc said U.S. regulators have cleared its $19 billion acquisition of mobile messaging service WhatsApp, even as the Federal Trade Commission warned the two Internet companies on Thursday that they must not backtrack on commitments to user privacy.

> The FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection, in a letter to the two companies on Thursday, said WhatsApp must adhere to its current privacy practices after the merger, including a promise not to use WhatsApp users’ personal data for targeted ads.

> “If the acquisition is completed and WhatsApp fails to honor these promises, both companies could be in violation of Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act and, potentially, the FTC’s order against Facebook,” the letter from Jessica Rich, director of the consumer bureau, read.

Lakshadweep in Trouble!,"Do plants feel pain?

The simple answer is that, currently, no one is sure whether plants can feel pain. We do know that they can feel sensations. Studies show that plants can feel a touch as light as a caterpillar’s footsteps. But pain, specifically, is a defense mechanism. If something hurts humans, we react instinctually to it—“fight or flight”—as do other animals. But plants don’t have that ability—nor do they have nervous systems or brains—so they may have no biological need to feel pain. We just don’t know.

BBC grilling BJP spokesperson on censoring tweets criticizing the govt on covid.,"You didn't misunderstand. This is sadly the viewpoint of the Indian government today. And to some extent, this is how our governments always have been. People appeal cases like these all the way to the supreme court, and the supreme court does end up overruling the government and rebuking it for violating Article 19 (freedom of speech) of our Constitution... but by the time justice is served, it's often months later and the temporary bans have already done their job successfully. 

Like, over the last one year, these are the reasons and justifications I've heard from spokespersons of the government for clamping down on social media:

1. Fake news (even when it's not)
2. ""Offending the sensibilities of religion X"" - almost any minor criticism (even legitimate) of religious practices (be it Muslim or Hindu) is often met with hostility.
3. ""Inciting violence"" - at this point, even someone saying ""we should flood the streets of Delhi and protest"" would end up getting booked under our IT act for 'inciting violence'. Whether or not they get convicted aside, the very fact that you can initially get arrested is a huge chilling effect on free speech. 

One incident that really stands out is the case of Disha Ravi - farmers in India were protesting a new law, and as a part of the protest Disha, along with a couple others were making a shared Google Doc with common talking points, template tweets and hashtags users could share and some press releases. The government of India arrested her on charges of sedition because 'the toolkit was used by foreign actors to influence domestic agenda to incite violence'. Who were these foreign actors? Celebrities like Greta Thunberg and Rihanna. 

At this point... I kinda feel sad about how ""anti-nationalist"" is commonly thrown around as a term for anyone who criticises the government. Maybe I'm going the other extreme, but the only day I'll accept India is really free... is the day someone could burn an Indian flag in New Delhi and not be charged (legally) as a criminal for burning it (unless they violate fire codes or their burning it harms other people there or if they do it with an illegal accelerant).

Extreme, I know. But the whole ""you're antinational and you can be arrested if you do X"" is a very slippery slope. We started out there - people who burn flags, support enemy states like Pakistan should be jailed. And slowly, we've devolved to this.

But it is possible to move towards reducing plastic. There are superstores opening up in European countries that are zero waste.

It needs a lot of push from the government to make it a financially possible option to big companies instead of a financial suicide to opt for alternatives.

> New Delhi: Farmers protesting for the last six months against the farm laws brought by the Bharatiya Janata Party government at the Centre have announced a &quot;Defeat BJP: Mission Uttar Pradesh&quot; campaign to be started ahead of the 2022 assembly elections in the state.

> Since the farmers&#039; protest against the three farm laws began, there has been a political churn among farmers across the state, especially in its western districts such as Muzaffarnagar, Baghpat, Shamli and Saharanpur, to take on the BJP. Farmers protest against BJP leaders in Western Uttar Pradesh.

> D.P. Singh, another AIKS farmer leader and an active protestor at Ghazipur border, says that due to COVID-19, the union has not yet actively started the campaign against the BJP. However, he believes that it is the right time to start the campaign as certain communities that were pro-BJP, such as the Rajputs, have voted against BJP in panchayat polls.

You cannot help but then make the claim that this is the effect of Islamisation of the state that women have no protection from the police against rape and that such cases are not taken seriously by the state govt and it's judicial system.

"Indians living in USA, Indian-Americans and US Citizens: Please ask your Congressmen and Senators to hold Twitter to task for helping Modi cover up COVID19 Crimes","I agree that Twitter wont have much of a spine as they are a company with the goal of making profits, but a US Congressional House hearing on why Twitter is aiding Modi govt attempts to suppress COVID19 situation will be very damaging for Modi govt's reputation across the world. In A US Congress hearing against Twitter (a US company) - Modi govt cant hide under their usual ""dont interfere in our internal matter"" nonsense. 

Let it come out , exactly who from the govt asked Twitter to take it down. Let it be known to the whole world what kind of monsters run the Indian government, where during a national red alert crisis, they are more focussed on controlling and censoring the news , rather than solving the situation. 

If I am not wrong, many Democrats have come out in the open to slam Modi government on various points, most recently on the farmers protest issue. However what is currently going on (suppressing news on Twitter, threatening students and online volunteer groups from carrying out community help ) is a completely despicable act , I think more people find out about this, that Indian govt is threatening Twitter and preventing people from actually knowing about whats going on in the country, more Modi govt's reputation will sink to a level beyond which any goodwill that Modi govt has created in its foreign relations would simply disappear and Modi's govt will be seen as non grata.


I think in asking Twitter to suppress such news, Indian govt hasn't thought about the fall out of such moves. Indian govt does things in a heavy handed way, but maybe this time they are forgetting that the world is interconnected, and COVID19 situation isnt just a farmer issue or or CAA protest, but a national healthcare emergency which is resulting in thousands of death every day, and suppressing the truth about this is nothing but unforgivable crimes against its own citizens. This would be a very good situation to corner the anti-constitutional autocratic activities of this government.",gvx1if3,/r/india/comments/myshgv/indians_living_in_usa_indianamericans_and_us/gvx1if3/,2qh1q,-2,-2

Rise of hatred in Kerala: travel blogger and family receives death threats and cyber bullying from radical Islam for visiting Ram temple in Ayodhya,"Where are you getting these bullshit facts. It wasn't a revered temple nor is it the birthplace of Ram. It's not Kedarnath, it's not Vaishnodevi , it's not Dwarka or anything. It was a Small Ram temple in Ayodhya that was destroyed. Modern Ayodhya isn't even the same as the Ayodhya in which Ram was born, the locations are different. Yes Babur destroyed the temple and another temple/mosque was built on the same land but then this mosque was burned down by people and then the Supreme court further granted the land back to the people who had a hand in burning down the Mosque essentially. How would this be fair to Muslims wouldn't you be outraged if something like this happened to a temple. Suppose there's a 300 year old Hanuman temple and people randomly started claiming this is where Muhammed was born and there was a mosque here and then proceeded to burn the temple and then rebuild a huge grand mosque there. What would be your reaction? 
Besides if someone is actually a Hindu by the book you're supposed to find Har Shan me Bhagwan. The ultimate ideal of Hinduism isn't found in a temple, it's within ourselves.

Everything is going exactly as planned to blame Diwali for pollution.,">I have problem with you equating both issues to be equally problematic while Diwali isn't. I

I never said Diwali is as large a problem as other pollution sources. But it is easiest to control. Because we people can easily control it. For instance, doing a firecracker show for the entire society instead of each individual doing it independently.

>You are talking like you can't see what's going all around you, target killings, beheadings etc

This has nothing to do with what we are discussing. You are now bringing tangential issues to the discussion that are not relevant here. My comments are specific about the post.

Pollution. People here act as if Diwali does not cause pollution. It does. Now there can be a million other sources. And efforts should be made to reduce pollution in all those areas. What is there to disagree with?

If only reason to do something is culture and religion and if it damanges anything, why not think about doing it in sustainable way?


>It is a war related to religion till this day and if you choose to be blind to it, i can't help you with that. People do become protective of something if it's attacked again and again. I rest my case.

I can see what is going around. So attack what is wrong.

For instance, if someone tells us to ban Gita, aruge and oppose it. There is no reason why one needs to ban Gita. 

Firecrackers do cause pollution. It is a fact.

J Sai Deepak's Advice for Indic minded students preparing for government exams | Buddhi India,"I operate in an industry even more regressive & systemically hateful of Hindus than bureaucracy, Tech, startups to be precise.

Here are a few tips I use:

1. Keep two accounts from two separate emails where your anonymous account can't be tracked back to you. It should be good enough to fool IG's algo that your anonymous account is never recommended to anyone who follows your main account. *Never ever cross follow or DM from one account to other.* This gives you plausible deniability in case you say something a little too spicy in anger.

2. Keep your main account generic, neutral and only post positive stuff. And when I say neutral, I mean not a single political post in 5 years level of neutral. Do not skip out on posting positive achievements of govt as that of India, Indian Science, beautiful temples, beautiful paintings and sculpture from museums, etc. Never cede any ground on anything generalizing anything negative about our country, our religion though, never. Feel free to label the other person a hater and bigot for doing it, you've built up enough neutral points that people will stay on your side.

3. Whenever I deal with an anti-hindu bigot in business, there's always a 5% bigotry charge added to costs but still do business. Consider it a bigotry cess. How do I know the person is a Hindu/India hating bigot, you ask? They are lefties, they post that shit day in and out on their Twitter, IG, FB, clubhouse rooms, just Google them. Lefties in bureaucracy are arrogant like that too, have close family in bureaucracy, know this first hand. 

4. In personal conversation situations too, the rule is simple. Avoid all political discussions if you can, focus on the matter at hand instead. If it can't be avoided, reply with, ""am sure other side is just as passionate as you and they have some good points too,"" ""let's not be classist bigots and play down the importance of amenities our privileged selves take for granted like water, electricity, decent infrastructure, etc."" ""the natives here have been invaded and subjugated for centuries, they deserve empowerment just as black people and first nationers do in US and Canada,"" ""yaar, you're too political and negative, let's talk when you're in a better mind frame,"" etc. Always say these generic but, totally neutral and positive lines with a smile as a last sentence before fucking off from the conversation. 

5. You personally need to sanitize your IG thoroughly, hey, feel free to delete the account and get a fresh one because it was ""hacked"" or something. Plus it'll help you focus on studies so you can actually get selected and bring about change from within. 


Remember, only with power can be bring about meaningful change. Don't forget who you are, where you come from or your values. Keep the fire of resistance inside you burning.

P.S. If you Crack it and make IAS, do DM me, always good to make friends in bureaucracy as an entrepreneur :)",i1qz8nf,/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/tk7ayw/j_sai_deepaks_advice_for_indic_minded_students/i1qz8nf/,3d4x4,2,2

Congress and Ayodhya,"> But resorting to open displays of faith to pander to the Hindu vote bank?

Many religious Congress leaders do that openly. Even Indira Gandhi.

> Declaring Rahul Gandhi a janeudhari Brahmin in hopes of getting some upper caste votes? 

Sometimes you have to state the obvious when faced with the ludicurous but vicious propaganda from WhatsApp university that claims Sonia Gandhi secretly got him baptised as a Christian in the vatican by the Pope. 

> The fact that the Congress is now forced to resort to such tactics is a sort of ideological victory for the Sangh. 

I agree partly with you. I wouldn't call it an ideological victory though as the Congress has always understood the role of religion in politics. Heck, even our constitution mentions the cow! 

> The BJP and its relentless propaganda have brought out the worst in Indians, and it looks like things will be going downhill for a while now.

That is a very true observation, and I agree with you. In fact, this is the greatest political challenge that the Congress has to overcome. Many of their own supporters, who are polarised by the constant media propaganda of ""us vs them"", feel angry at the Congress leadership for not behaving aggressively like a Modi or Yogi or the Sangh and thus consider the Congress ""weak"". This in turn demoralises and makes them even more angry and feeds into the whole ""us vs them"" black and white mentality.

Rise of hatred in Kerala: travel blogger and family receives death threats and cyber bullying from radical Islam for visiting Ram temple in Ayodhya,"It was a Church first and then when the Ottoman Empire came in, they redecorated it and changed it to a mosque.

Both communities suffered and the weaker one lost more. It was a pretty old mosque with a lot of significance to the local population. The original Ram temple was a modest temple for the localities.

Rajasthan BJP MLA Sanjay Sharma posted this on twitter & later deleted it,"Well said bro. But issue is only when religion start to become politicised. Government has all the power to curb religious fanatics if any. In Pakistan they have constitutionally mentioned themselves as Islamic nation. So when this happens it becomes a troublesome thing. 

However in every country there's some basis of division that politicians use( like racial division in USA).In India it is cast as well as religion which is somewhat unfortunate cause it surely creates a divided society. 

But most importantly it is the economical development of a country that shapes the society. So India if develops well, then education will spread too and then less chance of Pakistan like fanaticism.

But yeah just like Islam transformed to jihad , I hope no religion take that journey cause that's harmful. Anyway if I go with real Sanatana Dharma , it is very rich but unfortunately even in India there are many illiterate who try to be kattar hindu but don't know much about their own religion a lot and that creates a problem. There are basically goons trying to justify their actions behind mask of religion.

Congress and Ayodhya,"> Priyanka is not channeling Mohandas Gandhi's Hinduism, she's playing hindutva light. 

What about this statement from Priyanka Gandhi is Sanghi Hindutva:

> *The world, and our own sub-continent's history and culture, bears the indelible imprint of Ramayana. The Indian psyche has always been inspired and encapsulated the spirit of Dharma, righteousness, duty, sacrifice, compassion, love, bravery and service, that runs through Ramayana - from north to south, from east to west, the 'Ramkatha' has manifested itself in immeasurable forms - just as the Lord has infinite incarnations, 'Ramkatha' has infinite forms.*

> *Ram is courage, Ram is unity, Ram is tolerance, Ram is fraternity. Ram belongs to everyone. Lord Ram is the good and well being of all. This is why Lord Ram is called 'Maryada Purshottam' (the epitome of principled conduct and righteousness).* 

> *Lord Ram symbolises sacrifice as also shelter. Ram belongs both to 'Sabri' as also to 'Sugriv'. Ram belong to 'Valmiki' as also to 'Bhasa'. Ram belongs to 'Kamban' as also to 'Ezhuthachan'. Ram belongs to 'Kabir', to 'Tulsidas' and to 'Raidas'. Ram personifies each one of us.*

> *Ram is an assimilation of all cultures, castes, class and religions and beyond any such barriers of language, regions or castes. Mahatma Gandhi's 'Raghupati Raghav Raja Ram' bestows divine wisdom and equanimity and Waris Ali Shah said, 'Rab is Ram'. Noted poet Maithali Sharan Gupt, described Ram as ""the strength of the oppressed and the voiceless"", while Mahapran Nirala described Lord Ram in his classical words as ""the power of eternal truth"".*

> *The 'Bhoomi poojan' ceremony of Ram Mandir in Ayodhya has been scheduled for August 5. Hope this event becomes a celebration of national unity, brotherhood and cultural harmony in accordance with the message of Lord Ram and with his blessings.*

Well I can agree with you on that. As that has happened in Assam as well. But as an Indian I do want something like NRC to legitimize the citizenship. You won't believe the amount of illegal immigrants infiltration in Northeast. NRC(or something similar) is the only hope there. I'm not sure about rest of the states. But immigrants do enter through NE and reach rest of the Indian states. I came across Bangladeshi rickshawalas in Delhi once. 

Usually people have documents needed to produce. But not always though. There will always be people, especially in a country like India, who might not be able to produce documents. I wonder what can be done for them. A relative of the 5th president of India isn't in the NRC. Also it has been fairly easy for people to appeal in case they were left out of NRC.

>!Issac Newton was a Practising Christian and Himself wrote in Principia Mathematica that God is The Ultimate Cause of Everything.

Argument from authority. It's a logical fallacy, look it up. 

Newton's contribution towards science and maths were driven by the European culture, not religion. That's what my original comment was about. 

>!Don't forget Neils Bohr(Taoist), Werner Heisenberg(Had conversation with Aurbindo Ghosh, a prominent Hindu Philosopher) Schrodinger (Named his dog 'Atman' and himself wrote many times in his notes that The Upanishads are the best).

Again, argument from authority. Also, having open discussions with religious philosophers doesn't mean you subscribe to the religion itself. 

>!Einstein himself was a fan of Religious Philosophies.

He clarified however that, ""I am not an atheist"", preferring to call himself an agnostic, or a religious nonbeliever. Einstein also stated he did not believe in life after death, adding ""one life is enough for me."" He was closely involved in his lifetime with several humanist groups.

Kejriwal says ’The Kashmir Files’ is a ‘jhoothi’ (fake) film. The Chief Minister of Delhi is now officially a Genocide denier,"Haha okay! My language and logical skills are fine enough to respond to your petty comments. I’ve a thousand things to do apart from being a spokesperson unlike you so forgive me if my comment was all over the place. 

Anyway, let’s come to the point. I’ll ignore a couple of comments you made above because they’re full of shit. You think if you didn’t intervene into Kashmir, it would have become Syria/or some other extremist state. You’re an idiot, I’ll just say that and move on.

Now, you accusing me of of being a Pakistani parrot, see that’s the problem with you people. The moment someone speaks the truth, you just label them Gaddar, Pakistani, or terrorists or something else that feeds your justification of what’s happening in Kashmir. 

Again I’ll say, Kashmir was never a part of India. It was a princely state, the king made a pact with Nehru about Indias intervention into Kashmir to fight Pakistan incursion but it was never followed by india in terms of plebiscite.

Every kashmiri today hates Indian occupation. They’re the people who had been living there and it’s their right to decide who they want in the form of government. That’s called democracy which we don’t see much under Modi government btw. Whatever you know, you learned it from Indian sources and that’s not necessarily true all the time. No country would put something in their textbooks or acknowledge publicly their wrongdoings. For example, text books in Pakistan doesn’t mention about Kargil and their defeat. Similarly, Indian text books will never show the true MAP of india, that’s right the map you see is not true. India claims entire Kashmir as it’s part but some park it POK and Akashi China which is not ours. Google it or look a world map by UN.

P.S. I don’t think you know the history very well my friend. If you knew, you wouldn’t be arguing here. As a note, I would highly suggest that you visit Kashmir and see how Indian army treats all the civilians. Oh I’m sorry, they’re terrorists not civilians right?

That they drove out lakhs of kashmiri hindus and ethnically cleansed them because they were kafirs is proof enough. That they shouted slogans of ""convert,leave or die ""while saying ""we want hindu women,not men"" is an undeniable testament to the fact that kashmir wanted to become ISIS.

Everything is going exactly as planned to blame Diwali for pollution.,"Air pollution is not the only concern, on larger scale global warming is even bigger threat than pollution in few cities. And USA is 2nd largest offender and contributor to global warming.

Coming back to the topic... So instead of year long efforts to curb air/noise/chemical pollution etc (from automobiles, industries, dust, construction, burning stubles etc)and wasting or polluting millions of gallons of water everyday, we should just wake up on bunch of festival as annual routine and blame people random people and go back to sleep for rest of 360 days. It's like pollution doesn't happen rest of the year except few festivals. On top of that we are also selective on when firecrackers make air/noise pollution. 

For example occasion vs air pollution from firecrackers
Diwali --> yes, 
new yr --> no, 
weddings --> no, 
any other celebration --> no, 
big ass fireworks of some Bollywood bimbo's wedding --> no.

Unpopular Opinion : Your views on Hijab are immaterial to what's happening to the girls in Karnataka,"I don't have a definitive opinion yet. But I have noticed this.

I see everyone telling it should be one's choice. And not be forced. But why don't people enforce that choice or freedom when they yearn for a favourable outcome.

Now given the situation of a school, you are probably not personally held responsible for wearing or not wearing a specific type of clothing. In the sense, I don't think most people when they are 18 or 20 have a true sense of what their religion means. Or deeper understanding or reasoning of certain things. It is mostly forced upon. Be it burqa, hijab, sacred threads, turban or anything.

But when there is a situation, when there is truly a choice, say a job interview, there is no written rule that you cannot wear burqa or hijab etc...yet they mostly choose to not get their religion come in the way to getting that favourable outcome. I.e getting the job.

Why is it so? When you truly have the choice, one chooses to ignore it, but when mandated against a choice, one tends to cling on to the choice.

What later ""civilizations""? There were no civilizations in mediaeval Europe. The whole continent was inhabited and converted into farmland. A civilization implies a particular region or river valley where cities are established. 

Also literally none of the characteristics of Greco-Roman civilization existed in Renaissance Europe. Democracy? Poof. Gone. An army based on military training?

Everything is going exactly as planned to blame Diwali for pollution.,"That's a very aggressive and illogical response. I see you aren't thinking rationally, but il say one thing.

I'm just asking whether it makes sense to dismiss the pollution caused by a very intense, highly polluting festival, on no better grounds than whataboutism. 

It's a strange line of argument you're trying to make. ""If we do a little bit of pollution for good reasons, like travel, every day, why can't we do a shitload of pollution for a less good reason on one day""? I presume one could have a diwali festival without all the pollution if there was a will to. But the first step is actually admitting it's an issue.

Unpopular Opinion : Your views on Hijab are immaterial to what's happening to the girls in Karnataka,"> The father of the two minors, Mohammed Sunir, had gone to court after their Christ Nagar Senior Secondary School, located at Thiruvallam near Thiruvananthapuram, had said they couldn’t wear long sleeves starting academic year 2018-19. Deeming short sleeves un-Islamic, Sunir had moved court. In December 2018, in a single bench order, Judge A Muhamed Mustaque ruled that a petitioner cannot seek imposition of individual rights over the larger interest of an institution, and that it was within the domain of an institution to decide a dress code.

How the Pakistani Lobby in the US/West has infiltrated and influenced academic and historical studies of India and Hinduism,"The dream of the Muslim homeland had had strange consequences. And strangest of all was this: the state that had appeared to some as God itself, a complete earthly reward for the faithful, lived not so much by its agricultural exports or by the proceeds of its minor, secondary industries, as by the export of its people. The newspaper advertisements called it “manpower-export.”

The business was organized. Like accountants studying tax laws, the 
manpower export experts of Pakistan studied the world’s immigration laws and competitively gambled with their emigrant battalions: visitor’s visas overstayable here (most European countries), dependents shippable there (England), student’s visas convertible there (Canada and the United States), political asylum to be asked for there (Austria and West Berlin), still no visas needed here, just below the Arctic Circle 
Finland). They went by the planeload. Karachi airport was equipped for this emigrant traffic. Some got through; some were turned back. 

Abroad, the emigrants threw themselves on the mercies of civil-liberties organizations. They sought the protection of the laws of the countries where the planes had brought them. They or their representatives spoke correct words about the difference between poor countries and rich, South and North. They spoke of the crime of racial discrimination and the brotherhood of man. They appealed to the ideals of the alien civilizations whose virtue they denied at home. 

From: Among the Believers: An Islamic Journey by V S Naipaul. 

The Pakistanis are more numerous, and have been far longer in the West. Besides which, the Pakistani government spends a lot of money on such lobbyist groups. 

If we want to fight this we have to do the same. And going by the fact that we are far larger we can do it on a much bigger scale.

- you can’t slaughter the animal in front of other animals that will later be slaughtered
- you can only kill animal for the purpose of food, not sport
- animal must be slaughtered by the jugular vein, with a very sharp knife, making it quick and painless. Also very clean as all the blood drains immediately

Many comedians in the West make fun of the mismanagement of their country of origin but they don't stoop that low.
All the themes/problems acknowledged by Vir Das in the video were either half-baked or one-sided. I do find merit in some subjects but a whole action is an irresponsible act, spelled on the wrong platform.

Like:
1- Rape: ""We"" worship women during the day and rape them at night. Thank God Vir Das didn't add 'We come from an India where we cover women from head to toe and tear their clothes at night' otherwise his core audience would get hurt and things would get communal. And every sane person is aware of this heinous crime and tries his best not to let it happen anywhere in any form.

2- Bollywood: We on Twitter claim to be divided over Bollywood and still united by Bollywood in the darkness of the theatre, he said. The darkness of theater to watch the film, which tried to whitewash the image of an actor involved in the 1993 serial bombings.

It's the construct that we provide them with it's what they judge us on and just like any stupid act that goes on the generalize the public of a nation that has more to offer than the bad .

The National Register of Citizens (NRC) is a registry maintained by the Government of India containing names & certain relevant information for identification of Indian citizens of the Assam state. The register was specifically made for Assam state. However, on 20th November 2019, Home Minister Amit Shah declared during a parliamentary session that the register would be extended to the entire country. The register was first prepared after the 1951 Census of India and since then it has not been updated until recently.The North-East Indian state of Assam has become the first state in India where the updating of the NRC is being taken up to include the names of those persons whose names appeared in the NRC of 1951 and are still alive; and/or of their presently living descendants who have permanent residence within the state.

Congress and Ayodhya,"Ok I stand corrected. I didn't know about the League of Militant Atheists (thanks for pointing that out!) and I completely forgot about the Enver Hoxha regime. 

As far as I know, most communist regimes in history have treated religion as a matter of convenience. Following the Bolshevik revolution, the USSR tried to stick to classical Marxism, advocating focus on internationalism rather than patriotism. But when the Soviets were reeling under the shock of Operation Barbarossa, Stalin invoked Russian patriotism, and a significant role in that was played by the Russian Orthodox Church, which was then granted various privileges. China has been actually meddling in Tibetan Buddhism, installing their own Panchen Lama as a counterweight to the Dalai Lama. Vietnam has also always had a strong Buddhist ethos.

But even if such an extremist atheist leader were to emerge in India, would he gain any traction?

There are things our _heroes_ did that were inhumane but we have decided that they are our heroes so they are, in some sense, our gods. 

Having said that if i really go back in history and see why all those movements started i will point out to you that they were a need of that time (maybe it would hard to imagine given that we were not present then and it would especially be hard for a person who in any sense can't relate to the people who went through those times).

So maybe yes. The people you call terrorists were made by circumstances and the overwhelming majority was simply trying to survive and save their loved ones. Remember the people you say were terrorists were also human beings who got hurt and _someones_ neglected their pain and when they burst out crying they were hammered down.

I'm just reading out the facts for you.


>By saying that no chinese post have come up on Indian land, Modi has effectively relinquished all claims on points finger 4 and beyond. By Modi's admissions its china's land now. 

I'm not here to defend modi. You can abuse him as you like. 

Your OP misinterpreted the statement of MIA by army. So I pointed out the definition and the current situation in Aksai chin. 


>It cannot be denied atleast 20 soldiers died. Did Indian soldiers cross border and we accidentally invaded China or did they come over and killed our soldiers.

Read the 1993 agreement between India and China, 
China patrols upto finger 2 and India upto finger 8 are allowed until final settlement is reached. 

Brawl happened at finger 4. Agreement by no means relenquished the claim on aksai chin. But allows Chinese to patrol the land. 

. Losing 1962 war resulted in LAC and further agreements allowed chinese patrols upto finger 2. 

Like POK, Aksai chin is occupied by China, is Claimed by India but not controlled by India.. For lack of terminology area between finger 2 and 8 serve as temporary buffer until final settlement is reached.


>It also raises the questions, if no encroachment happened. Where did the galwan brawl take place?

At Finger 4 area where Chinese allowed to patrol but not allowed to build permanent constructions. 

"">Did Indian soldiers cross border and we accidentally invaded China or did they come over and killed our soldiers.

As Chinese allowed up to finger 2 and India up to finger 8, denying either party to patrol upto allowed areas or constructing between these two will be breach of agreement.

Brawl happened at 4 so, both the parties remained with in their agreed limits. 

So neither.

As I was saying, it's not like a waghah- attari border where it's clearly demarcated international border. Where if you accidentally take few more strides you end up in others territory.

They declared massive tax cut for the corporates which torpadoed the government finance. However, the government expenditure is increased a lot because of a lot of freebies and some big projects like that useless port and the new megacity project etc.

To finance all these they printed a lot of money and took a lot of loan. They cancelled low interest Japanese and IMF loans but took Chinese loans with higher interest because it was easier to swindle.

The pandemic hit hard Srilankan tourism sector, a big source of foreign currency.

The government did a demonization of chemical fertilizers to make Srilankan agriculture 100% organic. That stupid decision massively hurt the agriculture.

Due to that the Lankan government was forced to import a lot of food grains which cost them a lot of foreign currency too.

The agriculture problem also resulted in less production of tea and coffee, two biggest export items of Srilanka.

"An attempt to address the list of ""simplified"" explanation that is floating around in an attempt to justify the Citizenship Amendment Fact","I'm still a little bit skeptical, still on the fence, about this whole issue and want additional clarification:

>Indian Muslims will now require extraordinary proof

What is the extraordinary proof that will be required and how will it be different from the proof that non-Muslim-non migrants will require?

If you are not in the special case covered by the CAA, you'll be subject to rest of The Citizenship Act, 1955, which lays out [four principal ways](https://indiancitizenshiponline.nic.in/acquisition1.htm) through which Indian citizenship can be acquired (Birth, Descent, Registration and Naturalization). Wouldn't a lot of people be eligible at least to acquire citizenship by naturalization? As far as I know, the 1955 act applies to every person irrespective of their religion. Only the CAA lays out a special condition for non-muslim migrants from three countries, that of a reduced time (five years) to be eligible for naturalization.

The purpose of the NRC would be to make sure that everybody tagged as an Indian citizen has the documented proofs that establishes at least one of the four principal requirements under the 1955 act, namely Birth, Descent, Registration and Naturalization.

For example, one of the proofs would be something that can establish that you have been a resident of India for 12 years, so that you're eligible for citizenship by naturalization. My understanding is that it's not that hard to demonstrate that you have been resident in India for twelve years for most people.

It might be hard for the homeless but wouldn't that be a problem for everybody? Including non-muslims who aren't migrants? Because the CAA only applies to non-muslims **who are also** migrants from those three countries and have been a resident of India since at least 31 December 2014.

And even if you don't have documented proof there are other provisions [such as witnesses or local proofs supported by members of the community, as clarified by the MHA Spokesperson yesterday](https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/no-indian-will-have-to-prove-ancestry-common-documents-will-be-enough-mha-1630201-2019-12-20).

I think that people might be confusing the Assam NRC process for the one that will be implemented nationwide. The Assam NRC guidelines were laid out by the Supreme Court in 2015 specifically for Assam and as of today no official guideline, or process or procedure exists for the nationwide NRC exercise.

So I'm not sure if it's right to be jumping to conclusions if we don't even know what the nationwide NRC exercise will look like.",fbhx8gp,/r/india/comments/ebdeup/an_attempt_to_address_the_list_of_simplified/fbhx8gp/,2qh1q,0,0

Even in Assam, where they've already implemented the shitshow, they haven't managed to kick out even 1 bangladeshi. What they have done, however, is deprive 1.9 million people of their citizenship based on flimsy excuses after making 31 million people jump through hoops for years.

Former Diplomat K. C. Singh Ponders The “Internal Matter” Conundrum of The Indian Government,"Yes, I am. Being an atheist that's been one of the major points I use while pointing out the 'evils' of religion. I've shamed and slammed forceful religious conversions, destruction of religious worship places, and conversions on pretext of marriage (without context). I condemn and speak against violence perpetrated in the name of religion and justifying it in the name of spreading the word of god.

This is an issue of wording. The words you used tend to show that you're okay if hindus or any other religions are in the centre of everything. India has seen several mob lynchings in last six years, thousands of unlawful arrests, destruction of life and property of religious minorities, and violence planned and executed in the name of god. 

It's been one year of violence in Universities like JMI, AMU, and JNU, and I haven't seen anyone even accepting that they did it. They couldn't arrest any student in these cases because that's a part of propoganda and even after fabricating truths they couldn't get away with. The violence was perpetrated by the agents of the ruling party to help them mould a certain news, and they got away with it. What about that?

What about Gauri Lankesh and other journalists killed by saffron mobs? What about people killed on 'suspicion' of carrying beef, which was never substantiated? What about professors lynched and tried to be burnt? What about women and children raped? What about animals raped? What about shaming and arresting an actress on possession of weed while several 'saints' get away with it easily? What about religious hatred spewed by political and religious leaders spewed from public platforms?

I've collected all available records of UPA censoring free speech. Congress made 18 requests/day to Facebook and 15 requests/day to Google. That is when 70% of the country didn't even have access to the internet.,"First of all that is not what I said; it is one thing to criticize the current government's policies, it is quite another to claim that the country had more freedoms prior to the current government coming to power. The entire narrative of the opposition has been that ""freedom"", ""democracy"", ""secularity"", were part of the old India and not the new India, which is entirely false, and needs to be called out as false.

Asking Twitter to appoint an officer within India is quite a normal request; Twitter has no problem appointing officers in the US (who have gone so far as to ban an American president, and many of his supporters) nor does it have any problem adhering to European or Australian laws and empowering individuals working for Twitter in those countries to take such decisions. It is only India where they demand all requests from the government be sent to the US, as if they are not capable of hiring Indians to make such decisions. It is perfectly reasonable for the government to tell Twitter they need to assign local officers to deal with incoming requests. None of the other companies have an issue with this. Google agreed. Facebook agreed. I mean who wouldn't, this is a perfectly reasonable request.

And no, it was not about dissent. It was about people spreading vaccine fearmongering, and people coordinating riots such as the one on republic day, using social media. The government has no problem with you guys posting things like ""modi is useless chaiwala"", ""chowkidar chor hai"", ""surgical strikes were a jumla"", etc, on social media.

The only reason Twitter was able to create so much drama out of this situation is thanks to individuals such as yourself, and the parties you guys support. In your brain, when you see that the Modi government have a disagreement with a foreign social media company, you view it as an opportunity to attack the government regardless of the merits of the situation. Twitter knows it has useful idiots like yourself on its side, who might even go out onto the streets to protest on their behalf, which is why it can behave as if Indian laws don't apply to it.",gzuc1qu,/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/nn035c/ive_collected_all_available_records_of_upa/gzuc1qu/,3d4x4,1,1

It's aaolutely hilarious to see some right-wing bankers suddenly criticizing the Government now,"I was thinking about this too. I'm imagining it as something like, an image, where its starts with this. first they came for, and shows the first victims.
It should have an image, a popular one would be better, of that event with a date on it. Hopefully on top of it all, a mixed crowd should be shown, all whom are supporting, but after each event, the victim group from the supporters should be not be there in the next image, as in, for eg, if bankers are there in the group, after an event that pisses of bankers, in the next image of the supporting group, the banker should be removed. So its like the supporters become less and less, but also show the govt getting more powerful after each event.



So for eg, 


First they came for

*shows an image of the first Muslim getting lynched* under it, the day and date should be shown.


And then they came for


Next major victim group, with an actual image of the event. Again, popular image is more better, as it will be recognized easily.


It should continue , and then left as fill in blanks giving it a,to be continued vibe, for future groups, who will be in their target soon. Maybe something like a scroll select, that u get when choosing months online. Like it shows what's next, and what comes below that and so on.

Sadly no,this isnt the truth,Taking away one form of recreation always leads to another form taking its place.Also pubg as a diversion form work and cause for unemployment is just plane wrong.Games especially games like pubg are played on good and costly hardware ,they have to be bought by some cash,this cash is either provided by family of a young one or someone buys it with their own money,the monetisation system is also based on FOMO this means game insentivises the player to spend money ,combined with the need for good internet pubg will at the minimum cost you Rs140 to play a month through the minimum expense you have to play for a 4g internet.This means the average pubg player is either taken care of by a guardian with no insentive to work or by someone who earns enought to spend on luxury.

Also ,games have been tested and researched on a lot to prove wether they cause some harm.There is a possiblity of addiction and lazyness but that is true of nearly every non-physical hobby.You can call your self a book worm and read twilight all day developing none of the skill same with games.Also game especially shooters are known to increase mental awareness,reflexes and attention to detail therefor a tool for increasing focous and skill.There is research that show games like league of legends are even more complex then games like chess.

Also ,counties that play most games are countries that are some of the richest and have least unemployment.eg-Canada,Japan even PUBG is more famous in South Korea which is one of the best countries in this regard.Also games like pubg have made kids millionars and have given rise to jobs like professional gamers and youtubers ,jobs really not possible before.

The only takeaway from this or ""truth"" from this is one failed government blaming other more failed government using thing that were not present in their time.With the ban hammer looming over every foregin app all this is giving is an escape to these stupid politicians to bann something and gain sympathy and goodwill because people find every anti-establishment and calim that appeals to data true.withouth resolving the real issues like communistic policies,excessive red tape, bad education,illetracy and lack of policies to support small bussiness , wide spread curroption ,and really personall and behavioural issues plaguing societies that stop them from taking jobs.",fziq87o,/r/india/comments/hz9umz/modi_govt_wanted_to_ban_pubg_but_realised_youth/fziq87o/,2qh1q,-1,-1

Just got abused on the train by a hyper-nationalist woman for a really absurd reason.,"bro aunty was chatting shit

but just for curiosity I typed some something similar in search engine. turns out like lot of other mythologies, ours had the 2 dogs of Lord Yama/ Yamaraja. Not going into detail, those interested may search for themselves. 

However, I will say this, the topic of mythology is so vast and complex that we still interpret it in different ways. I've seen many people say that this idea was already in our mythology, which to be fair isn't different from other mythologies; but often these things turn out to be true, because the possibilities in mythology exceed in what we are currently capable of thinking.

So anyone(specially ones from previous generation) who say ""Yeh to hamare shastro me likha tha""; isn't technically wrong. THE GREEKS DO HAVE A 2 HEADED DOG THO.

They don't call themselves Anglo Indians. I don't think they ever called themselves as such. Today's Anglo Indians aren't identifiable on any parameters because they are completely mixed in with the local culture hence no need for reservation hence no protest against the removal of reservation. 

And you are comparing Nazi with Anglo. One is an ideology/political party and one is nationality/race. There's no comparison. If you have British ancestry there's no way to deny that.

BJP is wayy too eager to accept any Muslims in it's lower ranks to show that it's an ""inclusive"" party to outsiders. They at least have to maintain a facade of accepting Muslims so that they don't appear totally genocial. These people however don't even make it to the mid ranks of the BJP, let alone to the upper ranks. 
They are mostly used for show.

That's why you see so many photos of BJP leaders in Muslim areas with their people.

Even if not ban them people themselves should understand not to buy them. Reasons you ask?


1. I hate the smell of smoke, and I don't feel like breathing just like when a smoker passes by me.


2. Many animals like dogs and cows are sensitive to loud sounds. To jo log kutto or Gau Mata ki raksha ke liye uchalte h unhe bhi ye support nhi krna chahiye. And I too don't like loud noises.


3. Know where those crackers come from. Majority of them are made in China. Un paiso se wo log hmare border pr Ptake phodenge.

6. Now, Some people would add the point of kids. Well they obviously aren't mature enough so even if parents buy them they shouldn't buy a laaaarge amount of them, and also make them understand the real celebration of Diwali.

7. And those who are saying that firecrackers aren't harmful or aren't real reason for pollution, know the chemistry of those crackers and biology of your body.

Seems like more than one problem can be dealt with simultaneously.

Also, frankly, no one bursts crackers because 'it is the tradition', I'm quite sure. At least, most of us. We (used to) burst crackers because it was FUN. That's it, and it gives us a sense of nostalgia. Idk, I can't make claims that crackers were mentioned in any of holy scriptures or not because a lot of times, lines in scriptures are poetic and may be metaphorical too, but it's really not like we follow scriptures to the T, right? Come on. 

Small aspects of cultures change with changing times and changing needs, and Delhi is specifically vulnerable since it already has high levels of air pollution. So, any reduction helps. Why not?

Also, Independent Thought v UOI - Section 375 of IPC, the age of rape in case of wife was raised from 16 to 18 by the court, not the Parliament. Thats an amendment.

Principle of severability - when the provision in question can be severed from the rest of the legislation, then only that provision is deleted.

Thanks Delhi - For giving India some hope,"Desaffronization (or avoiding saffronizining) of the states is always welcome. But I have so many things to be concerned.

1. INC can claim that they gave moral support to AAP so that the votes don't get divided. But that's just because it was extremely weak to start with. And even if it did do it with nothing but pure love for country in heart, it's a sad state of affairs when the main opposition party of the country which is supposed to tackle the Bhagwa brigade is reduced to this level in the capital itself.

2. Vote share of BJP in 2015 Assembly elections - 32.2. that too in the peak of Modi wave. 
Approx vote share of BJP in 2020 assembly elections - 38.43.
The vote share (and seats) actually increased. 
The Shaheen bagh vs us campaign DID work.

3. Leaders like Manish Sisodiya won by 3k votes. He was trailing since the morning. And he is second in command as well as the one who is given credit for educational reforms. This could have been a disaster. A loud phew.

4. AAP did a good amount of work but it can not be denied that freebies played an important role. Spending 1720 crores on subsidies out of 1790 crore energy budget is one of the things. How will it play out in future when there can not be any more freebies?

> This is 2018-19 data for the number of political murders across India, Bengal tops with Bihar and Jharkhand following it.

If you knew anything about NCRB reports, you'd know that the data is provided is by state police. And political violence is a direct result of incompetence and collusion of state police. After all, if we go by NCRB data Bihar never had much of a jungle raj under lalu, which no one sane wold even claim today.

Yeah, let's totally ignore that UPs population is around 5 ties of Kerala. Totally.

>According to rough estimates, **over 200 persons belonging to different parties have become victims of killer politics in Kerala since 2000**.

In all of this, there’s no issue of multiple voices or second-guessing (“Arey waise toh hum Modi ke against hai, lekin toilets banaane mei ya Ukraine se students waapas laane mei BJP ne achcha kaam kiya hai” isn’t the kind of stuff that makes them stop what they’re doing). There’s unity and there’s clarity and there’s never been a shortage of effort. 

No matter how vile, they have never been short of effort to earn the appeasement. Hindus on the other hand have been so complex that there’s nothing to do appease them. Kuch ko toh mandir hi nahi chahiye, kuch ko Kanhaiya’s killers se zyaada Nupur ko blame karna tha, etc.

"""2 Judges Can't Decide"": BJP MP's Strong Objection On Same-Sex Marriages","You aren't wrong to say that Hinduism is technically not a religion but a way of life and that some of the problematic practices we have now were corrupted by those in power.

Since Hinduism is a way of life, I consider culture, lifestyle, rituals, and dharma as Hinduism. Not just the dharma. That is because unlike Abrahamic religions we do not have an absolute text but guidelines. So, all these factors constitute the religion.

And that is also the basis for my comment.

Regardless of what original intention may have been, the practices had, at some point, intertwined with Hinduism. These faults existed long before Mughals and British came in. It was exploitable and exploited before others exploited it.

With time, we slowly separated right from wrong and will continue to do so, but not all of these problems were ""planted"" by outsiders. Given that our society had been practicing them for centuries before anyone came in, we share responsibility.

""..*but atleast Hinduism or rather the practitioners knew what was right and what was wrong to just stop practicing*""

Yes, this is also what I was saying in my previous comment when I said Hinduism *has progressed with time and with time, we will overcome what shortcomings we have.*

But people didn't just stop practicing, they applied the dharma with their times and slowly removed the bad components.

We need to do the same but a common problem I see is people assuming Hinduism to perfect and needing no change.

If Hindus were 10% as arseholes that communal Muslims are, Muslims would keep their heads down and mind their own business.

All my adult life, the issue always has been Hindu-Muslim and it will continue for the rest of my life because Muslims can easily be made chutiyas in the name of Islam and can made to pit against Hindus. Unless Muslims work hard to get out the cesspool they are in and get educated to come out of the ummah mindset, we will have the same story over and over.

And Islam/Christianity are predatory in nature. Hindus will have to work hard not to get their lot stolen cause numbers make the difference.

If the Chinese had not released them we would have never known about them. Indian government literally disowned our own soldier. This is what is call Anti-National.,"that's exactly what I'm saying, You as a citizen have the power. You don't think they're doing a good job, vote them out. If you're not able to, maybe it just means people don't share the same opinion as you. And as I've said earlier, BJP can literally bring whatever rule they want in the parliament as they've a clear majority. So, I can't emphasize enough the lack of a strong opposition. An opposition's job is to keep the power of ruling party in check.

These organisations adhered to GDPR so why shouldn't they adhere to laws of our country provided the laws are sane.

"Rahul Gandhi: ""There Are Queues for Oxygen and Outside Crematorium, but PM Narendra Modi Is Obsessed With Saving His Image. PM and his government did not even acknowledge there was a problem and also did not act on scientific advice or evidence, while ignoring rising cases.""","> you think that doing something for a person/committee is appeasement

Appeasement was a wrong word, I probably shouldn't have used. The point I was trying to make is, Congress hasn't helped minorities in our country and is only better than BJP because they haven't actively tried to kill them or drive them out of country (which is terrible by BJP and they should be punished for all the communal hatred). 

Regarding what Congress has done, I agree scholarships is a good thing, but Hajj is an appeasement in my eyes. I'm not aware how many and what scholarships BJP has stopped, but I wouldn't put it past them. Again, as long as BJP doesn't provide any special pilgrimage package for other religions, I'm okay with them cancelling Hajj.

It need not be ""us vs them"", we can have different opinions about RG's competency and credentials and completely agree that BJP has grown like a cancer and needs to be removed. Why is that a difficult concept to understand? I don't know if you understand what ""us vs them"" means, all I'm saying is I can have a different opinion from you on a particular issue, doesn't mean I'm against everything you stand for.

One more thing, Congress doesn't really follow (not anymore, at least) Gandhi, they just use his name because it helps them politically. If I'm against Congress, it doesn't mean that I support BJP. I can think critically for myself and make a decision.

> You do care about how BJP projects Rahul Gandhi thats why you talk negative about him.

Unpopular Opinion : Your views on Hijab are immaterial to what's happening to the girls in Karnataka,"I'll copy paste a comment I made elsewhere on this thread, about someone equating saris to burqas. Similar reasoning applies to your point (it's why I specifically mentioned controlling their entire bodies in an extremely explicit and dominant manner: i.e. total ownership).

How many women in India, Hindu and Muslim, and every other religion, eagerly look forward to buying saris? How many of them set aside some savings each year for saris? How many Muslim women would choose to wear a sari if given the option? How many women in the West wear saris when they attend Indian functions?

Now, how many Hindu women in India would choose to wear a burqa if given the option? Pray tell. How many women eagerly look forward to their yearly burqa purchase? 

The reason they are different is because the burqa is an apparent and absolute symbol of dehumanisation. The only part of you visible to the world is your eyes, maybe your face, the rest is monochrome and hidden. It is so far beyond any patriarchal vestige you associate to saris, and that is evident if you try to answer my questions above truthfully.

It says it all that people outside Indian culture are far more likely to wear saris gleefully and post pictures everywhere, than wear burqas gleefully and post pictures everywhere. 

Of course no one should be forced to wear saris. But I'd wager a lot of people would wear them with no forcing necessary. Can't say the same for burqas.",hw7uedu,/r/india/comments/so2gtj/unpopular_opinion_your_views_on_hijab_are/hw7uedu/,2qh1q,0,2

Everything is going exactly as planned to blame Diwali for pollution.,"Yes. 

It would take a beating, but it would survive. 

Hinduism survived so many barbaric invasions and colonial rules. And then fifty plus years of INC. Civilizations across the world couldn’t keep out Abrahamic invasions, but India (Hindus, Jains, Buddhists) could. Both the invading Abrahamic religions are two millennia old (at most) but there were many civilizations in the world way older than that: 

Egypt is mostly Muslim now. Latin American countries are mostly Christian now. Far-out continents like Australia have hardly any aborigines left, it’s a Christian country now. African countries are either Islamic or Christian now (places like Nigeria have so many people dying each year cos of clashes between these two religions). Parsis fled Iran too.

BJP has great leaders like Advani, Vajpayee, Modi, Shah, Yogi etc. but so far it has avoided the personality/family cult trap. Once a leader is gone, there are others capable enough to replace him due to the RSS fountainhead.

I've collected all available records of UPA censoring free speech. Congress made 18 requests/day to Facebook and 15 requests/day to Google. That is when 70% of the country didn't even have access to the internet.,"There is a bit of problem in such situations tbh, in case of private companies censor, you have the ambit of law and the state to help, when the state decides to censure you, then you don't have much recourse. 

Just because a government was elected doesn't mean that people who voted for them agree with all their actions. Democracy is not just elections. In the present case, big tech actions ofc may be wrong in many cases, their power doesn't even match up to the power of the state which decide the policy and legal structure of a country. Take an example you choose to give away your privacy to the state, which may be similar to how an individual using Facebook decides to use it while trading his personal info. While you have made a choice on your own to trust state more than companies, remember many of us didn't. We don't want the dilution of privacy. This is different as to tech companies in which if I don't agree with their privacy policy I can leave, because if I don't agree with indian government policy, then I can't do anything because every tech platform here will follow the government policy.

The founders may have political preference and they might not change easily, but their platform doesn't equate to it. Zuckerberg views dont matter much on how a user uses whatsapp. What you are concerned about is editorial actions of platforms of censoring or removing, which is why I say reform safeharbor provisions, which provides such protection to platfroms even they are doing editorial actions. Current action is using hammer when a knife was needed.

Court orders are needed but such orders can easily be provided even for investigation phase before and if the situation went to a trial. Moreover, court order isn't needed much as a competent authority as per law can also ask for user identity. By law the competent authority is the home secretary, which basically means the home ministry or the union Government.

I've collected all available records of UPA censoring free speech. Congress made 18 requests/day to Facebook and 15 requests/day to Google. That is when 70% of the country didn't even have access to the internet.,"Well generally right wingers are pro free speech. At least in other countries the right wingers are the ones who are pro free speech. I guess in India we just cherry pick worst part of all ideologies huh? 

Let me try to explain the case:

Private entities should be free to control speech on their platforms however they wish. 

For eg. I should be allowed to stop you from coming to my house and shouting. 

If people don't like Twitter's rules make a new twitter or people will move. 

Free speech is freedom from the government for speech. If the country doesn't like your speech there is little choice to change countries. Further they can put you in jail for it. Something which twitter can't do. 

Free speech from the government exists to protect novel ideas good or bad from the majority. So we should never move towards FoE as determined by the government.

Lakshadweep in Trouble!,">Praful K Patel even went on to enforce the Gunda Act

on another note 

**2019 Election Officer Coercion**

On 10 April 2019 Election Commission of India issued a notice to Prafu K Patel stating that his actions violated provisions under the Representation of the People Act, 1951. The commission reprimanded Patel for having issued a ""coercive"" request to Kannan Gopinathan, the collector for Dadra and Nagar Haveli, and withdraw any notices issued to Gopinathan or any other election officials ""during the election period."" Election Commission Officials state that Praful Patel called election officers to issue them direct instructions. Crucial interference from Patel came after Gopinath sent a notice to Mohanbhai Sanjibhai Delkar for actions that violated the model code. Praful Patel retaliated by issuing a notice to Gopinath which Election Commission Officials described as an act of political vengeance.[7] Since then, Kannan Gopinathan has been replaced with Sandeep Kumar Singh as collector.

**2019 Daman Indigenous Land Clearing Protests**

Valuable seafront land along the 700 metre stretch from Moti Daman Lighthouse to Jampore beach is claimed to be owned by adivasi fishing communities who have lived there for generations as well as by NRI Damanese predominantly living in Leicester, UK. In December 2018, local residents received official looking documents purportedly instructed by Praful Patel ordering the confiscation of their land and demolition of homes to make way for development.[8] In January 2019 Praful Patel hosted a hastily arranged meeting with British MP Keith Vaz but managed to allay his fears about the case.[9] However, by November the bulldozing went ahead and the Daman protests began.

On 3 November 2019, Daman Collector Rakesh Minhas issued a Section 144 order banning peaceful assembly of four or more persons, slogan-shouting and the use of loudspeakers across the entire district and ordered the conversion of two High Schools into 'temporary jails'.[10] 70 protesters were held in these 'temporary jails' and another 8 arrests were made.[11] Few of the adivasi fisherfolk were rehoused whilst most languished traumatised and homeless on the streets near the rubble of their razed homes.[12] As of March 2021 the site is now billionaire Binod Chaudhary of CG Corp Global's The Fern Seaside Luxurious Tent Resort offering tourist accommodation for $80US/£57GBP/6000 rupees for night in a tent.[13]

**2021 suicide of Mohan Delkar**

Tribal rights advocate and Lok Sabha MP Mohanbhai Sanjibhai Delkar hanged himself at Hotel Sea Green in Mumbai on 22 February 2021 leaving a 15 page suicide note.[14] The note held politicians and administrative officials responsible for ""injustice"", ""insult"" and ""bias"" meted out to him and specifically named Praful Patel.[15]

On 5 July 2020, Delkar had posted a video on Twitter threatening to resign as Lok Sabha MP because the local administration was ""hounding him"". Then on 19 September in parliament he raised the issue of ""misbehaviour"" by local officials ""as part of a conspiracy"" claiming that on Liberation Day (2 August), he was ""denied the right to address the people of the region as an MP"".[16]

First Information Report (FIR) under Section 306 (abetment of suicide), 389 (Putting person in fear of accusation of offence, in order to commit extortion) and 506 (criminal intimidation) and sections of Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989 was filed against Praful Patel, Daman Collector Sandeep Kumar Singh, former police superintendent Sharad Darade, and few politicians including BJP leader Fatehsinh V Chauhan; who has a history of land grabbing disputes.[17] Delkar's son Abhinav has alleged that Patel threatened Delkar to pay ₹25 crore (US$3.5 million) or he would be implicated under PASA Act.[18]

**Save Lakshadweep Campaign - 2021**

Following the appointment of Praful Patel as the Administrator of Lakshadweep, a campaign against the new administrator's policies gained momentum. On 24th May 2021, #SaveLakshadweep became a trending hashtag in Twitter India.

The official twitter handle of Kerala Students Union - the Kerala wing of NSUI was suspended for a tweet against Praful Patel on 23rd May 2021[19]. The campaign was mostly against the new administrations plans to deregulate alcohol and ban beef slaughter on the island. A majority of Lakshadweep's natives belongs to the Muslim community. It was claimed by locals that the administration was implementing Hindutva agendas.

I actually think the Agniveer policy is targeted more towards providing much needed temporary employment to the lower income group youth who end up getting degrees from random colleges, dont get jobs cos they lack any real skill and end up spending money on this useless degree.

Agniveer policy gives them much needed income, a lifelong set of skills and an excellent corpus upon their completion of 4 years(?) which can be used to start a solid small business (Atmanirbharta - where it is actually needed. It does not and should not concern the 0.0000000000001% population in India)

The narrative of asking people to stay in India is driven by the fact that people spend loads and loads of money to settle abroad and do low skill jobs there instead of creating jobs here when they have the money to do so.

Yesterday the government said there is no soldier of Indian army missing & today the Chinese gov released 10 Indian army soldiers. If the Chinese had not released them we would have never known about them. Indian government literally disowned our own soldier. This is what is call Anti-National.,"What's wrong with staying United against China? Absolutely nothing. That was my point. Our current PM had the chance to ""stand United"" against China as recently as 2013. Instead, he gave several speeches where he openly made fun of and blamed the government in power. Blamed them for being ""weak"", which is why China ""dared"" to cross our border then.

According to him, you needed a ""strong"" person like him in power, and then no country would dare mess with us. The rupee would magically strengthen against the dollar, and petrol would cost less than water. It would be a perfect India!

Well, here we are. Modi is in power, the rupee is weaker than ever, petrol is more expensive than ever, and we still have border incursions.

Why? Because these things are complicated. You can't just boast about the size of your chest. It takes years of effort to fix the issues he boasted about. Modi seems to be a marketing guy, not someone terribly interested in concerted effort.

I'm happy to be United, and to support India. But as responsible citizens, it is also our job to point out the dangerous and divisive rhetoric that was used by Modi, when he was seeking power. We should keep talking about it, until future Leaders (of ANY party) understand that it's not okay to be divisive, or use dangerous rhetoric.",fvez11n,/r/india/comments/hc01o7/yesterday_the_government_said_there_is_no_soldier/fvez11n/,2qh1q,-2,-2

It is because China knows that the person who is sitting at the top position, just cares about his image: Congress leader Rahul Gandhi in Patiala, Punjab","The average person in Punjab is disillusioned with all political parties, not just the BJP. The Congress government ruling Punjab is in power only because they were the least worst out of 3 available choices and they signified status-quo instead of ""2-steps-back"" in case of regressive Akalis. Congress should not see the current mandate with a lot of pride. Had AAP shown just a tiny bit of more competency, and a little less antics, they could easily have won the elections here.

It is easy to write BJP off, however it is also to be noted that any momentum behind current anti-farm bill protests is driven entirely by political parties such as Congress and Akali Dal. No farmers here have protested here of their own accord. Congress is supporting it because it is Congress ruled state and they have leverage here, and Akali Dal because the Badals have a major stake in the current Anaj-Mandi procurement system - a stake which some say runs into thousands of crores. Badals did not quit the central government due to any ideological differences - they quit because they saw the bill as a direct attack on the oligarchy they've built while they were in power.

"The new Indian | If Trump’s supporters blame Antifa for having conspired to ‘steal’ the election from Trump, Modi’s supporters are as convinced that ‘Leftists, libtards, and Lootyens’ are behind every attempt to criticise Modi’s government and his policies","Trump supporters get all their information from an incredibly airtight right wing echo chamber that is completely and utterly separated from the mainstream news. The two spheres are light years apart. Trump supporters do not trust mainstream news outlets in the USA. They think the mainstream media is peddling lies and falsehoods, because they are all out to get Trump and destroy America. This is why Trump supporters are able to believe that the rioters were antifa. Trump said so, and Trump's word is law, and the mainstream media, as well as the FBI, and multiple law enforcement agencies in the govt, are lying liars who lie.

This is not exactly the case in India. When Modi first got elected in 2014, right wing misinformation became mainstreamed in India in a way that hasn't happened in the USA. Republic TV is the biggest news channel in India. Remember how they spent months over the summer shrieking about Rhea Chakraborty and Sushant Singh Rajput. Vast segments of the population get their information from WhatsApp forwards, which the right wing has hijacked to spread their lies to a science. And there are very few progressive media outlets in India that are capable of combating the mainstream giants. The majority of them spend their time enabling Modi. Print media outlets have not been all that effective on this front either, and the few that do (Caravan, Wire, Scroll, etc.) are not widely read to really make much of a difference.

The problem is much worse in India. The marked increase of privately owned media outlets, particularly news channels, happened around the same time as Modi got elected. And 24/7 news channels are how a lot of Indians digest their information today. They have played a huge role in mainstreaming unquestioning support for Modi, and suppressing all criticism of him. To use the comparison to America, it would be as if the whole country thought Fox News was actually decent and factual, and channels like Newsmax and OAN are respectable right wing avenues for getting factual information, rather than batshit insane conspiracy theory peddling shit shows.

Priorities of respective governments,I'm quite apolitical. But it isn't so black and white. For example.

Except we came to know mamata never allowed it to implement in WB(where we live) because of her spite for Modi/BJP . And now that elections are coming she's recently finally announced her version of the same thing. Now people like these guards and poor may or may not be right wing. Who cares.

The detention center will cover approximately 2,88,000 square feet and will include a school, recreational area and hospital. The center has been sanctioned by the Union Home Ministry in June 2018, which is funding the entire project.It is the first of the many in-construction or proposed detention centres to be constructed following the exclusion of people from the final National Register of Citizens of India. In 2014, the Centre had told all the states to set up at least one detention centre for illegal immigrants so as not to mix them up with jail inmates.

Honest Rant,"Who told free is bad?
Too much of free is bad.

You got to check if freebies are hurting the state.
Is the state unable to develop as required because it doesn't have funds?
Are people being inconvenienced due to some extra charges that the government introduced to fund it's freebies?

If you have answers to these questions, you can question better.


It has been shown world over that a few freebies are good for the country in a macro economic sphere.


Some freebies from 1900's of the top of my head:
1 rupee ration.
Free mid day meals for students.
Subsidised fuel (diesel)
Subsidised train travel.
Subsidised farm input products.


All of these have helped the nation in a big way.

The song was adopted as an anthem of the anti-fascist resistance: by the Italian partisans between 1943 and 1945 during the Italian Resistance, the resistance of Italian partisans against the Nazi German forces occupying Italy, during the Italian Civil War, and the Italian partisan struggle against the fascist Italian Social Republic and its Nazi German allies.

Yesterday the government said there is no soldier of Indian army missing & today the Chinese gov released 10 Indian army soldiers. If the Chinese had not released them we would have never known about them. Indian government literally disowned our own soldier. This is what is call Anti-National.,"Military is in a way complicit as well. 

The whole Pakistan strike escalation in run up to GE2019 is part of this. The Govt till Oct-Nov 2018 was not having a good time and polling showed it. Post that border issue, it was basically over. 

Military has to show some spine as well. Even the China situation fundamentally is a Political problem between India and China due to border not being Politically Ratified. Military is a sideshow in this. 

We've seen this over and over again the world over. Militaries are Fighting forces, they are not supposed to do *Management*, be it Bureaucratic or those having Political angles. This is a huge reason US gets bogged down in Wars despite having the most powerful Military to have existed in this Planet's history. Yet those coups they orchestrate pay off better for them because right tools right objective. Done and dusted, move on. 

Indian Military time and again has said about India China border, that due to differing perceptions of border issues arise. Well Military can't solve this and management isn't what they should be doing, certainly not for 50 years and counting. This is how resources (human and capital) get strained. 

Military can't disobey the elected Govt, fair enough, but if they let themselves get used like this, the rot was there as well. And I've seen this slow politicisation of military in last 10-15 years happen. Too many former or retired officers being too political in public.

CM Kejriwal has a genius idea to boost the Nation's Economy,"For one thing, he's wrong when he considered Gandhi a politician par excellence,

To quote ""Gandhi believed that politics had to be guided by religion which treats all beings as equal and removes excessive greed from life. To many today, deeply sucked into comfort-seeking lifestyles, Gandhi may look impractical and too naïve for the complicated ‘modern’ world. But no one, not even his worst enemies, would deny that he was a “simple soul”, yet a gritty one, who became a powerful weapon to make colonialism history."" 

I try to be one of the few people who don't want to see Gandhi as a politician or a Mahatma
To quote Guha

""Gandhi is impossible to classify in terms of conventional political categories. Was he a socialist, conservative, liberal or all of these? He was a true original. The left came to a belated recognition of the moral greatness of Gandhi, especially because of what he did for Hindu-Muslim harmony. For a long time, the left claimed that non-violence was a devious way to wean the masses away from the revolutionary path, but its attitude changed after what Gandhi did in 1947 for communal harmony. The right essentially dislikes Gandhi. It is profoundly ambivalent about him but instrumentally knows it cannot reject him outright. So it tries to make him more of a Hindu, assimilate him into a line of Hindu saints, but anyone on social media would know the Hindu right detests Gandhi.""


And also for the genocide thing, Gandhi was with the Khilafat movement and when the genocide happened, he termed the moplaphs as 'misguided and ignorant' not because of any political leanings but because in Greek philosophy, namely Socrates, All good is knowledge and all evil is ignorant; the same goes with the concept of Maya in Advaita Vedanta",itx572c,/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/ydqq7s/cm_kejriwal_has_a_genius_idea_to_boost_the/itx572c/,3d4x4,-1,-2

They are attending AAP party rally in Gujarat but don’t even know who Kejriwal is… Paise dekar bheed ikhata ho sakta hain par sach to nikal jaayega. Video Courtesy BBC,"So I'll give you a basic info about why they are there. From their surname, Parmar, I can understand that they belong to the Vankar category which comes under SC - \*which I belong to too\*. 

Most Vankars were college educated but without jobs. Post Nationalisation of Banks in India in 1969, they were able to acquire jobs in the 14 banks that got nationalised then. Ever since then, they have been voting for Congress, as they were able to afford a better life. In the past 20 years since Modi, the relevance of Congress has diminished in Gujarat, and most SCs have been fed much hatred against BJP by the elders, who I believe might have reason to hate him. 

The caste discrimination in Gujarat was high back in the time, not that it is not present now, it still is, but in a lesser intensity. Then when a person from the SC community is disallowed for eg. riding a horse for his wedding, or keeping a moustache, which are thought of as upper caste things by upper caste people, and then there's little to no action on the perpetrators, the anger against administration and the ruling party boils up. 

Now since Congress is irrelevant in Gujarat, the only alternative is AAP. As with every rally, people are brought (read bought) in hordes from villages to show strength. Who is the leader is irrelevant; they know the party symbol, and they press the button. 

The newer generation of educated SCs vote for BJP as they know how things have changed and keep themselves updated on the ongoings. But that's a minority. Most SC stay in villages, but they still do not make up enough to oust BJP from power, hence there's not much of a threat.",ivnk59r,/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/yponl2/they_are_attending_aap_party_rally_in_gujarat_but/ivnk59r/,3d4x4,2,1

Also, women is any community are associated with that community's dignity and self-respect. That's why women have always been targeted by fringes to irk a community. To rile up a majority community, they show that women of that community are being mistreated by minorities. And similarly they try to agitate minorities by showing their women being targeted by a majority community. This has been a *modus operandi* of fringes for ages; women have been commoditized for hate and propaganda.

People don't want to acknowledge this but a majority of india has lost its critical thinking ability and is just going the way propaganda tells them to.

A few female students from rural Maharashtra, from underprivileged communities, filed an official complaint against the professor for ""vulgar and obscene discussion"". They associated all discussion of sex with ""vulgarity"" and mistakenly thought that the professor was being lewd.

That being said, there can also be second hand benefits even if only a few are heard. If one player in an industry is able to get favorable legislations passed it can end up benefitting everyone in the field.

BJP adopts every Hindu 🤡 What do you mean by masterstroke on its way?,"Shivaji? Dude muslims and leftists are insulting lord Shiva himself. Such insults were printed on freakin newspapers as viral memes. I am sure there are radicals on both sides. Difference is that while only the radical hindus participate in such activites, muslims of all kinds do it. You didn't see protests on streets or violence (kanpur) because of the shivling memes. You didn't see any organisation condemn them. 


Admit it. Hindus are weak and divided. Muslims are united from doha till Delhi. Nupur Sharma didn't even insult Muhammed. She literally stated what majority of muslims believe and is written in the shahih al bukhari hadith. 

I don't care for defending the Hindu radicals but since you are so inclined, even they aren't lynching muslims for being muslim but in suspicion of selling beef illegally. Anyway, those hindus should be and are punished accordingly.

Another low for Punjab. Shiv Sena leader shot dead in front of Police. [Source: The Tatva India],"I think India should make deals with countries like Canada and the UK to drastically lower the number of Punjabi immigrants entering their countries and only accept non Punjabi Indian immigrants. Canadian and UK Sikhs are extremely radicalized and the Khalistan movement is mainstream in their bubbles, Indian Sikhs who emigrate there are very likely to become radicalized and indoctrinated themselves. In India at least, they are under our control, if they go beyond their limits, the police will take action against them, and the desire for Khalistan isn't as prominent. In Canada and UK, they can do whatever they please, abuse India as much as they want and they can use their newfound increased wealth to back and fund anti national elements.

Then, ramp up security and intelligence operations in Punjab, raise Hindu and moderate Sikh voices and arrest anyone trying to spread dissent. Educate the Sikh populace on the shared history between Sikhs and Hindus and their common origins. 

>jatt sikhs no one actually support it and they constitute no more than 25% of punjab population

True, but Jatt Sikhs make up about half of the Sikh population and they hold the most social and political influence and they're extremely outspoken.

I grew up studying in Tirunelveli which has 20% Christian population. I don't need a twitter handle to tell me what's going on in the places I grew up.

1. Conversion is rampant here amongst the Dalit community, but that is more so of a political/social movement that these pastors. Many Dalits claim they have converted to Christianity, remain Hindu on paper and even retain hindu practises like worshipping the local goddess.
2. Next method of conversion - conversion for hospital/school/college discounts + promise of job is also very common. No one converts for free food, the offer has to be quite worthy. This is operated through Christian hospitals/schools/social service/business.

3)Amongst the manipulative methods, the prayer method is common. Here the pastors do not perform public healing, but go in search of patients and tell them to pray to jesus to see if he hears their prayers. Remember, normal treatment is NOT discontinued here. Patients are in fact, strongly encouraged to continue their treatment.

As with serious medical cases, 20-30% of people do heal. When these people heal, these people approach the family and say Jesus has heard your prayers, so now convert if you have an inch of gratitude towards Jesus.

These open stunts are very rare, accounts like NoConversion post it, because you can't find video evidence for 1-3

That is automatically equal to a strong country.

As I said, I would say India is a developing country, but still in our villages people eat less as they don't have food, or eat shit like Bajra, unprocessed boiled bajra which is coarse and taste SHIT, wait, it doesn't even taste like anything in real life (I have eaten it in Maharashtra once). Why do they do that? Well, they are paid in Bajra not money, and they cannot afford anything else. 

Our own govt data shows that 60% of kids under the age of 5 are underweight, and out of those 60% kids, 90% and more are from villages only, and 40% from UP & Bihar combined.
The developing area in our country is the south where people are fed, infants are fed, yea they are not living like a GREAT life, but they are well enough.

But hey, 45% of our population lives in UP, BIHAR & WB, so yea, we are underdeveloped. If after 75 years of independence and 33% budget allocation to rural development, if farmers does suicides (which is hidden by the govt after 2019 because those cases reached 3000 or so), kids are not fed, or someone is beated to death because of drinking well water (5000 something case in this year of violence against low caste) and then fool populace is worried about Muslim rhetoric (400th case of Muslim injuring Hindus), then that is maybe one more reason to be under developed.

I'm not saying White dudes are gods or whatever, at least in their countries if there is injustice, society doesn't say it's your mistake. And issues are highlighted. And their wives don't have kids along roadsides among garbage, nor their kids are underfed.

Yes.

> And these same people believe that there will be wide spread ethnic cleansing.

Yes.

> Like Nazi Germany? In this day an age? In India??

Yes. Yes, its even easier now with quicker dispensation of propaganda and misinformation. Yes.

The details of holocaust started to come to light only after Germany's defeat in 1945. Throughout the world war, Germany maintained that the concentration camps only to provide labour needed to fuel the war machinery, and Jews are safe. Strong propaganda and disinformation machinery is the root of all facist regime.

No one actually believed Holocaust was taking place during world war, hell many don't believe it ever happened even today. Nazis were not the clear symbol of evil, they are now. They were the symbol of German Nationalism and Aryan pride (Sounds similar?). History is fuzzy in the making, and only _clearer_ in the hindsight.

If anything its much easier to divide and conquer India, due to its diversity, our differences and the ingrained DNA that makes a typical Indian wanting to best for himself, and not the general population. Also, you seem to have a lot of faith in India's law and order. I'd argue its misplaced.

Whereas some points like recovery of damage of public property etc is a straight-up copy of the UP government. Yes, it is welcoming though. And as usual, nothing to be happy about for the middle class. Also, the promises of govt jobs were made in 17 as well, but never fulfilled, so this time people are not even expecting it to be half-truth.

It is because China knows that the person who is sitting at the top position, just cares about his image: Congress leader Rahul Gandhi in Patiala, Punjab",">You will understand I'm centrist atheist who is disillusioned with both left and right. Hates religion and respects all genders

This is exactly me as well. Except that I am a practicing Sikh and not atheist. 

Personally, I hate both parties a lot. To me, it seems like people on this sub are thinking that getting Rahul Gandhi as PM is going to solve most problems (as long as he replaces Modi). The answer is NO. It will only solve half the problems but the Congress will bring new problems for the country. Rahul Gandhi is not some saviour. People only think that the country has become worse in only last 6 years despite the fact that the country has seen many ups and downs throughout the years. Situation was also bad in 1947-48, 1975-77, 1984-89, 1997-99, 2011- present.

I'll be honest, BJP is doing things that Congress has already done in the past.

Genocides- ✅
Divisive Politics - ✅
Corruption - ✅
Oppression on Minorities - ✅
Curbs on Opposition - ✅
Lack of Transparency - ✅
Misusing Judiciary - ✅
Provocative Statements - ✅
Kashmir - ✅

The only thing that BJP still hasn't done are :-

Fascism - ❌ (Emergency)

Editing the Preamble - ❌ (Indira edited the Preamble during the Emergency Period)

Nepotism - ❌

I can only see BJP becoming another version of Congress. It's ministers are arrogant, Prime Minister is completely out of touch with the realities on the ground. 

Unfortunately, people on this sub are completely out of touch with the reality. This happened in 2019 as well where many were actually predicting a BJP loss. Either they will support the farmers (who are protesting against BJP) and at the same time, call them ignorant and dumb just because many of them vote for BJP. Nobody has talked to people in the villages and ask them why they vote for their party. I've seen people on this sub calling all BJP supporters as stupid, anti-Muslim and bigots despite the fact that BJP voters are equal to almost 40% of India's adult population. 

You can't just call that many people stupid just because you don't like them voting for a particular party. A lot of them are centrists as well. You need to understand their reasons for voting for BJP and tell them why they are wrong. You can't just call them stupid first and expect that people are going to vote for the left.

Both Right-Wing and Left-Wing thrive on hate and negativity. BJP is absolutely horrible but so is Congress. I hope, people on this sub realise that quickly.",g7zpk3p,/r/india/comments/j6i5yf/ani_do_you_know_why_china_was_able_to_take_away_a/g7zpk3p/,2qh1q,0,-1

Also I haven't seen the RSTV video you linked -- it's 28 mins long!

All Ahmadis did not go to Pakistan, many chose to remain in India, where they are considered Muslims by law. Those that did go to Pakistan went for three reasons:

1. the author of the Lahore Resolution that states Muslim-majority regions should be independent, was Muhammad Zafarullah Khan, a president of Int'l Court of Justice, whose father was a companion of the founder of the Ahmadiyya movement;
2. the successor of Ahmad, the founder, told his followers to support the Muslim League and (through the cleric of the Ahmadiyya community in England) made Jinnah agree to return to India;
3. the Ahmadis were allowed to found a city, Rabwah, in Punjab, Pakistan, in 1948.

These reasons gave the Ahmadis a false sense of security in Pakistan, but the religious persecution soon started, with an anti-Ahmadi riot as early as in 1953. So, in short, the Muslim League pretended to represent them ('cause religion) but all they wanted was support. Once they got that, they fucked them over.

&#x200B;

Articles 14 ~~and 15~~ gives any person (not just Indian citizens) equality before the law ~~and protection from discrimination based on religion etc., respectively~~. Both of them are in Part III of the Constitution, which are *Fundamental Rights*. **Any** law the Government/Parliament makes is subject to Fundamental Rights, and as such any law discriminating based on religion (as CAA explicitly does) is *void* (Article 13(2)). So CAA is unconstitutional.

&#x200B;

Any oppressed people, be it Palestinians, Kurds, or even Indians during the Raj, have radical elements prone to violence (think Bhagat Singh, Khudiram Bose or Aurobindo Ghose), which both results from and is directed towards the oppressor. Once the oppression ends, so do the radical activities. The radical Mukti Bahini of Bangladesh stopped its activities only after they gained independence from Pakistan, in which India played a big role. As the most powerful country in South Asia, we have a responsibility to preserve the peace in our region. This can only be done by liberating the Rohingya, and with our help they will stop their radical acts, just like Indian freedom fighters or the Mukti Bahini.

[Payal Mehta] Violence caught on cctv said to be attack on a BJP workers home in Kasba,">lynchings closer to home

which are totally law and order problems and have nothing to do with religion

""intolerance"" in a country where Madarsas brainwash children to hate idol worshipping polytheistic pagans (Koran 9:5, 9:29, 3:28, 4:11, 21:98 and other similar verses) and government funds these 'religious institutions'

""secularism"" in a country where non- muslims cannot manage mosques and non- christians can't manage churches but for Hindus:

**Our Temples do not belong to us.** In most of the states, Governments have passed acts and legislations to take over Hindu institutions including Temples, Mutts and Endowments. This has enabled the Government to interfere in the Temples’ management, practices and rituals. Not just that, Temples’ properties and income have also been usurped by the Government. The most outrageous fact is that the Government exerts such a control exclusively on the Hindu Temples; the places of worship of other religions enjoy freedom and autonomy. This is a clear-cut case of systematic discrimination and harassment.

From education to ecology and culture to charity, Hindu Temples have played a pivotal role in shaping the Indian society. Today’s India has become a battleground for the clash of civilizations, and the Hindu society is facing an existential threat. The need to revive the Temple eco-system is more important than ever. But this cannot be achieved without freeing them from the clutches of the State.

The Government’s control over the Hindu Temples is unconstitutional and immoral. Hindu Temples belong to the Hindu society and the State must exit immediately.

While the state governments control over 4 lakh out of an estimated 9 lakh temples across the country, there is no such control over Muslim and Christian religious bodies. In this backdrop, there are demands to amend “The Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments (HRCE) Act 1951”, which allows the state governments to take over temples and maintain complete control over them and their properties.

There are over 15 state governments which control only Hindu religious institutions, specifically temples—right from the appointment of administrators to mandatory collection of 13-18% service charge. This takes away the community’s right and resources to protect its interests. This, according to them, is discriminatory as only Hindu community suffers this kind of treatment. It violates the concept of secularism. Also, the Indian Constitution does not permit the State to run religious institutions.

Those advocating for equality say that the process of taking control of temple riches was started by the Mughals and was followed by the British rulers. After Independence, the Jawaharlal Nehru government continued with the policy of controlling the temples by enacting the HRCE Act in 1951. “To the contrary, there is no such control over mosques and churches. We demand that in the same way, temples should also be freed from any kind of control. The government must amend the Act, which is the root cause of the problem,” said J. Sai Deepak, noted Supreme Court lawyer. He also pointed out that traditionally also the “Raja” (king) does not have the right over the wealth of the temple.

*How could Indian courts recognise Sharia-based Muslim Personal Law while claiming to be secular? How could Central and State governments take over the management of Hindu temples if they were secular? How could a secular government provide financial assistance to educational institutions run by religious organisations? How could a secular government codify and modify Hindu personal law? How would the government extend the existing caste-based reservations to minority religions if it were secular?*",gwqvmer,/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/n3fvao/payal_mehta_violence_caught_on_cctv_said_to_be/gwqvmer/,3d4x4,1,2

"Smriti Irani's son recently graduated from a foreign University. However, not a single Media house named the University.","Mostly because we massively overload them. While underfunding them. Delhi University has an undergrad intake of tens of thousands of students. Master's intakes of hundreds. Meanwhile there have been no permanent faculty hires in years, so now a majority of the lecturing is being done by Ad-Hocs and Guest Lecturers who are basically PhDs and early career scholars who cannot grow in their fields because there is no job security and shit pay.

And why is that? Because we neither support our unis, nor give them autonomy. They have regularly faced budget cuts, even as the government makes them take more and mroe students (usually with each reservation reform) because the brand value and demand for higher education is high. So they bow down to public pressure and arbitrarily increase seats. Meanwhile everyone wants to get in, and nobody likes being left out, so the application sizes are enormous. And the government rather than trusting them to select for themselves, imposes arbitrary central exams usually poorly designed. And with shit primary education, too many students getting in don't have basic skills so the colleges also need to focus on improving their language and reasoning abilities.

Fact is we're simply asking too much of them and just not paying them enough. DU should honestly be half a dozen university instead of the super organization that it is incapable of functioning effectively because of its massive size. And we just need more universities. There are more good universities in a single US state than there are in the entirety of India.

Unfortunately that requires the government to do something it hates.

1. Give more money
2. Give autonomy. Help the institutions build up, but stop imposing insane bureaucratic rules on them that destroy research capacity.

Instead for the last 3 decades we've done the opposite. Fixing it would be a generational effort. Not gonna happen in a few years. And I'm not sure if we, as a people, have any sort of patience for it.

"An attempt to address the list of ""simplified"" explanation that is floating around in an attempt to justify the Citizenship Amendment Fact","I found this statement the most surprising so i googled around a bit myself. 

From my understanding(i could be wrong) what this statement essentially says, before now India would have zero refugees as we dont have to accept any as we are not party to any Convention or Protocol. Simple searches shows that India has freely accepted refugees from both Tibet and Sri Lanka. 

So saying that Muslims from 3 countries(or for that matter any person from any other country) would not legally be able to get refugee status and then sub-sequently be able to apply for Indian Citizenship is incorrect.

Also from the page of the Indian National Bar Association([https://www.indianbarassociation.org/indias-refugee-policy/](https://www.indianbarassociation.org/indias-refugee-policy/))

>Even though India is not a signatory to the 1951 Convention on refugees and also the 1967 Protocol, it is a signatory to a number of United Nations and World Conventions on Human Rights, refugee issues and related matters. Hence its obligations in regard to refugees arise out of the latter.

me: if someone identifies as nazi, they must not live in germany or any nation which supports the right of jewish people to breathe / be alive.

you: they are mixed and not nazi - they would never have lived with jews if they were nazi.

me: well, nazi have routinely spoken about racial purity so they will have kicked these mixed persons out & hence they did not go with nazi and remained with the jewish people.

you: they are mixed and not nazi.

You see what's happening here? Just replace nazi with the other invader (with whom certain persons identify by prefixing the race of the invader ahead of ""indian"") and replace jews with tribals/natives of Bharath.

You said that X will have gone to britian if they were british and not stay back in india. I showed that the brits of that time (1947) were openly racist & put up boards saying ""\_\_\_\_\_\_ and dogs not allowed"". Thus, these mixed persons such as X will have faced abuse if they even tried to go to britian. And, you are back saying X are not gora, they are not british.

If there is no differentiating factors then there is absolutely no reason to add the prefix on the word ""indian"", is there? The fact that these persons choose to voluntarily identify themselves with said prefix means they claim ancestral roots with the abuser, with the invader.

Again, going back to nazi scenario. Even if a person knows that 2 - 3 generations ago some of their ancestors worked for the nazi ss & some were jewish, today that mixed-race person will not proudly add 'nazi-' as a prefix to 'german'.

Luckily, I'm well versed in the matter due to my keen interest in mythology and history, i have had many such arguments with bigots like that, i must say it's quite fun to destroy their entire belief system using their own belief system, howeven ultimately they will never change, its just you score a point or two and have some fun.
That's why i still love to argue in train, it's even more entertaining for me now, because the entire nation it seems is trying to become either a historian or a priest, and that's really the best time for someone who was once considered a nerd, and wasn't able to find a single person who was interested in history.

Regarding the TN news you mentioned, I haven't followed it well, so will get back after I go through it properly. But from what you've said, that seems extremely wrong.

>And it's not only this country , its everywhere

I might not agree here fully. If you compare the media in the US, there aren't a lot of crackdowns on media houses. A comedian Hasan Minhaj, Indian ethnicity and a religious minority but still manages to run a political show and has criticised the US government without a scratch on him. A lot of media outlets can use strong language against even their president, something for which you could go to jail here.

I'm not saying we should follow suit, but there should be room for healthy dissent and the government should answer those qns. Also, opposition's role is to ensure the government is kept on its toes.

Suzanna Arundhati Roy blames Indian government and Indians for occupying India,"What you suggested is commonly held belief, which is not wrong. Though it only shows half picture.

Here is the full picture.

- The person who is butchering the animal has to be male and Muslim -- means one less job opportunity for non-muslim. If this is not discrimination, what is? How is it different from you saying I will not employ any Muslim in my office?

- Some islamic prayer (forgot what) has to be recited before cutting.

This was just related to the meat aspect.

Here is the kicker. There is a halal certification which Islamic agencies give to products. One of those islamic agency is Jamiat Ulima-i-Hind. It charges Rs 20,000 for registration of an Indian company and Rs 500 for each product (GST charges are extra). Then there is renewal fee of Rs 15,000 as the registration is valid only for one year. 



now what does Jamait do with this money?

Jamiat to give legal aid to 2 ‘al-Qaeda suspects’ held in Uttar Pradesh

File plea against Ayodha

and many more.. Now you understand why they have a strong support from the community? Because they are not paying for it. You and I are..

Edit:

Also one of the criteria for halal certification is the entire chain has as much muslim business / muslim people involved as possible.

edit 2:

vegetarian products can be halal too. How to check if product is halal certified?

I've collected all available records of UPA censoring free speech. Congress made 18 requests/day to Facebook and 15 requests/day to Google. That is when 70% of the country didn't even have access to the internet.,"The NSA PRISM surveillance system along with all the data leaked by Snowden does raise issue about the government intentions in developed countries. But the difference is that those countries have a well defined and comprehensive legal system to protect user privacy. The fallout of the revelation of PRISM system was a huge shame for the US government not only domestcially but also internationally. 

In many cases, the US government used zero day vulnerability to snoop into data, and didn't ask or take the user data from platforms, there also still the populace hated it. Obama was hounded on NSA spying. After which they had to reform and platforms under pressure reduced their co-operation. An example is apple refusing to open iphone.

In comparison to USA, we do lack a comprehensive legal statue and supporting laws to even the power imbalance towards individual and companies vis-a-vis the state. We also lack a strong judicial system to help in case of undue violation of privacy by the state.

I don't know what you mean by USA emergency tbh, If though the concern is domestic data being taken by US agencies then the solution is data localisation or higher level of encryption or using a domestic platform with servers based in India. In some cases to help in law and order, it could also be mutual sharing of data through mutual agreements to help law enforcement, where both sides can help each other.

What kind of dual faced people are you willing to bring to and keep in power in this country?

Indians are the most peaceful people when they migrate other countries and they adopt their languages as well. I don't know where did you get this misconception from. I didn't know they speak in Hindi with foreigners. /s

Film industry as a business was started by a Marathi, Dadasaheb Phalke. And only a butthurt like you would throw such stupid questions like why there is Hindi film industry in Mumbai. And for your information that industry is not only run by Hindi speaking class but half of its backstage people are Marathi from spotboys, designers to art directors. 
If Marathis had grudges against Bimarus then they wouldn't even let anyone work here. Now the limit is being crossed which happened back in 80s as well. 

Like population is not even in Bimarus' dictionary. They keep coming and still not stopping it. They behave exactly like Baba from Baba ka Dhaba.

Those are not mere stories, just read about him and his contributions. There are lots of books. Who was Shivaji by Govind Pansare or Raja Shivachhatrapati by Babasaheb Purandare could be a good start. Ashoka was Bihar and he did exact Bimaru thing for power. We are proud our maharaja wasn't like him. If he had not been born, you would've been born as a servant in Mughal's house. Check out Marathas contribution before speaking ill about their bravery. 

Btw I've also heard this incident from my friend. A bimaru was working in his office and one day he started distributing sweets for he was going to become father. My friend asked how could it be possible as he had not even gone to his native home for months. He said, his brother was there to help. This is a kind of custom in UP. 

Maharashtra is the most welcoming state, but if anyone tries to spoil its culture and heritage and be hypocrite like you, then people of the state won't entertain it.

BJP Gujarat 2022 Manifesto.,"> guarantor

So, one has to have a connection with someone having good economic standing...?

> Wash out taxpayers money... Pressure of repayment
1. Not getting a job can be because of no fault of the student, like - an abrupt change in the market.
2. Why should we resort to creating mental and economic pressure, when the incentive of good earning from a job well done is enough?
3. This useless pressure is the reason for the lack of a good culture of exploration and innovation in our country. If we dream of being a leading economy (on a per capita basis), we must enable our citizens to take risks.
4. This economic cost is a reason why many can't pursue a field of their passion. If we relax this constraint, the economy will have a net benefit in aggregate.

> ...Subsidy and freeby only makes you relaxed 
1. A decent standard of living and leisure is literally a directive principle of state policy.
2. Government spending is useless in ""current expenditure"" type of things. However, it's the good thing to do in ""capital investment"" type of things - like infra, greenfield PSUs.

Of course, had the situation been better, then people wouldn't have to find enjoyment in video games; we would actually lead a happy and balanced lifestyle, with a fulfilling career, relationships, and such.

The people however accusing trans women of this have indeed a long history of their men sneaking into women's bathrooms and commit assault (republican politicians, look it up). You also dont seem to realize that it is the other way around: Trans women get frequently assaulted by others in the bathroom simply for existing (no matter which bathroom they use, but the women's one is much safer for them). Do you care about that or are there some innocent humans that u think are not deserving of basic safety when peeing? There are entire statistics about it that u can look up.

You guys noticing what's happening in Sri Lanka?,"Firstly, I am not saying it, the great communist magazine the Atlantic is saying it. But I am guessing you didn't even read it before commenting. So here the sections which I felt are relevant. In case you feel I am quoting it out of context or other such things, go ahead read it from the link.

""The prime example of this is the Sri Lankan port of Hambantota. As the story goes, Beijing pushed Sri Lanka into borrowing money from Chinese banks to pay for the project, which had no prospect of commercial success. Onerous terms and feeble revenues eventually pushed Sri Lanka into default, at which point Beijing demanded the port as collateral, forcing the Sri Lankan government to surrender control to a Chinese firm.

Our research shows that Chinese banks are willing to restructure the terms of existing loans and have never actually seized an asset from any country, much less the port of Hambantota.A Chinese company’s acquisition of a majority stake in the port was a cautionary tale, but it’s not the one we’ve often heard.

It was the Canadian International Development Agency—not China—that financed Canada’s leading engineering and construction firm, SNC-Lavalin, to carry out a feasibility study for the port.

We reviewed a second feasibility report, produced in 2006 by the Danish engineering firm Ramboll, that made similar recommendations to the plans put forward by SNC-Lavalin, arguing that an initial phase of the project should allow for the transport of non-containerized cargo—oil, cars, grain—to start bringing in revenue, before expanding the port to be able to handle the traffic and storage of traditional containers. 

Armed with the Ramboll report, Sri Lanka’s government approached the United States and India; both countries said no. But a Chinese construction firm, China Harbor Group, had learned about Colombo’s hopes, and lobbied hard for the project. China Eximbank agreed to fund it, and China Harbor won the contract.

This was in 2007, six years before Xi Jinping introduced the Belt and Road Initiative. Sri Lanka was still in the last, and bloodiest, phase of its long civil war, and the world was on the verge of a financial crisis. There is a bunch of detail in the Atlantic article about how it was financed and Sri Lanka chose the worst deal for itself.

For a conflict-torn country that struggled to generate tax revenue, the terms of the loan seemed reasonable. 

Some more details.

When Sirisena took office, Sri Lanka owed more to Japan, the World Bank, and the Asian Development Bank than to China. Of the $4.5 billion in debt service Sri Lanka would pay in 2017, only 5 percent was because of Hambantota. The Central Bank governors under both Rajapaksa and Sirisena do not agree on much, but they both told us that Hambantota, and Chinese finance in general, was not the source of the country’s financial distress.

There was also never a default. Colombo arranged a bailout from the International Monetary Fund, and decided to raise much-needed dollars by leasing out the underperforming Hambantota Port to an experienced company—just as the Canadians had recommended

Sri Lanka chose China Merchants, making it the majority shareholder with a 99-year lease, and used the $1.12 billion cash infusion to bolster its foreign reserves, not to pay off China Eximbank.""

The Uganda international airport has been debunked already. Here is another communist article written by Maoist whose nation is extremely friendly to China.

https://www.orfonline.org/expert-speak/china-and-ugandas-entebbe-international-airport/?amp

Again, I am quoting the part which I feel is relevant, but if you feel I am quoting it out of context , go ahead and read the article.

""Details published in a report in the Daily Monitor newspaper stated that Uganda allegedly had to “surrender” one of its national asset—the Entebbe International Airport—to China’s EXIM Bank for defaulting on its loan repayments. 

In the aftermath of this development, Ugandan authorities have been consistently insisting on three issues: The grace period is yet to expire and that the Ugandan government is confident of not defaulting on any obligations on repayment; that the terms of the loans are semi-concessional in nature and in line with Uganda’s infrastructure financing programme.

most of these claims are truthful.""

If that is the case, then is there a sizeable population of Muslim minorities in these predominantly Muslim countries?

Supposing someone’s parents or grandparents have been Indian citizens from 1947 onwards but they don’t have their documents with them. Will their children or grandchildren - having been born in India to Indian parents, who presumably have some form of documentation- not be able to confirm their citizenship?

Yo, smartass, the performance they're talking about in that line is that of the national statistical agencies that collect and process the data, not performance in terms of gdp growth.

In india's case, statistics is not a problem. Our statistical organization is among the best, and was put together by pioneers like Mahalanobis who not just put together our system, but came up with statistical methods for the world to follow. Our problem is that informal economy can't be directly measured through taxes, banking data etc., and thus its contribution to gdp is estimated, using surveys that happen, iirc, every 5 years or so and unless the estimate is close to reality, the gdp number is grossly misleading. SBI did its own survey and estimates that the informal economy was 20% of the total gdp in 2020. We continue using the 50% estimate that came from before the 2016 self goal and the other two shocks the informal economy suffered in our gdp measurement.",i32dtir,/r/india/comments/tt1ryh/you_guys_noticing_whats_happening_in_sri_lanka/i32dtir/,2qh1q,0,0

May 16th: “Shame on Govt for sending vaccines abroad”. June 1st: “Shame on Govt for not sending vaccines abroad”. Is this a joke? Dirty politicising of the Pandemic by the Congress perfectly captured by 3 Shashi Tharoor tweets.,"*Reposted because of heavy downvoting.*

This is really indefensible. How shameless do you have to be to display such inconsistency and hypocrisy? How are we, the citizens of India, supposed to take the opposition’s criticism seriously, when they constantly destroy their credibility like this? Criticism of the Govt. is extremely important in every democracy, but those criticising have a responsibility as well. You can’t just constantly say nonsense to mislead and confuse people to fulfil your personal agenda, specially during a crisis.

What they’re essentially doing is trying to create constant anti-Govt headlines to build a specific narrative in people’s minds, without any care for what they actually say. It’s happened multiple times now; another example is Vaccine procurement. When the process was centralised, Opposition parties attacked the Govt. saying that States should be allowed to privately procure. When the Centre granted their wish, within 2 weeks they shamelessly attacked the Govt for not fully centralising the process. They’ve turned the country into a circus.

Usually, I would say this is normal for politics, everyone is always trying to weaken their opponent, but to do it during such a big national crisis, at a time when the entire country is under attack and needs to unite, is a new low even for the Congress. There are enough things to responsibly criticise, enough ways to point out genuine shortcomings so that the entire country benefits. Instead, here they are just spreading constant nonsense propaganda to further weaken the country at its lowest moment, solely for political gain.

"An attempt to address the list of ""simplified"" explanation that is floating around in an attempt to justify the Citizenship Amendment Fact","Please try to understand basic things here, before looking at **OR** word, try to understand what is after **OR** and what is prior to **OR**.

**Provided that any person belonging to Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi or Christian community from Afghanistan, Bangladesh or Pakistan, who entered into India on or before the 31st day of December, 2014 and who has been exempted by the Central Government by or under clause (c) of sub-section (2) of section 3 of the Passport (Entry into India) Act, 1920 or from the application of the provisions of the Foreigners Act, 1946 or any rule or order made thereunder, shall not be treated as illegal migrant for the purposes of this Act.**

Sub-section (2) of section (3) of passport entry into India act just gives power to center government to make any exemptions in any condition of this (Passports) act.

This is done to keep up CAA to be in-sync with passports act future amendments (if any).

There is nothing for a citizen to fulfill in this, this reference is just for government.

Also, I would like to add, **the latest amendment to Passport entry into India act, on 8 Sept 2015, changed passport act to allow non-muslim refugees on the basis of religious fear from these countries to stay in India even if they had/hadn't entered the country with valid papers prior to 31.12.2014.**




And lets come to the next part with **OR** 

They are saying, along with being these minorities from these specific countries, person should fulfill criteria of foreigners act, 1946 (latest amendment), which clearly states 
in paragraph 3A, that 

**Exemption of certain class of foreigners.- (I) Persons belonging to minority communities in Bangladesh and Pakistan, namely, Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains, Parsis and Christians who were compelled to seek shelter in India due to religious persecution or fear of religious persecution and entered into India on or before the 31 st December, 2014 with or without valid passport/travel documents are hereby granted exemption from the application of provisions of the Foreigners Act, 1946 and the orders made thereunder in respect of their stay in India without such documents or after the expiry of those documents, as the case may be, from the date of publication of this order in the Official Gazette.**

"An attempt to address the list of ""simplified"" explanation that is floating around in an attempt to justify the Citizenship Amendment Fact","> Core issue is that around 1.2 million illegal Hindus who are in Assam will be given citizenship 

**That's just a *jumla* of Modi *kaka* to fool his *bhakths*!**

- Hindu foreigners can be given citizenship only if they claim to be victims of persecution from Pakistan, Bangladesh or Afghanistan. 
- Once you claim that, the intelligence agencies will interrogate you.
- Only if they believe and verify your story will you be granted citizenship. 
- Bangladesi Hindus can qualify under this clause as Bangladesh is listed in the CAA.
- But all these Bangladesi Hindus in Assam have already either claimed to be persecuted victims or claimed to be indians.
- I remember reading (or maybe it was from Mr. Chidambaram's interview) that all those who claimed to be persecuted were investigated by the intelligence agencies. And so far out of these lakhs of claimants, only **31,000** or so were adjudged as genuine case. 
- So now, after CAA all those who lied they were indians but couldn't prove it, will now have to lie and tell a new story - that they are not indians, but foreigners and persecuted victims of evil Bangladesi muslims - to get citizenship under CAA.
- As Shri. Chidambaram how can we believe their story now? And how will our intelligence agencies investigate those millions of stories!?

Only a tiny fraction of black money is held in cash. Therefore it was completely expected that notebandi wouldn't make a deny black money. And it didn't. 

Informal economy in ostia was large, and it depended on cash. It was expected that the informal economy would be irreparably damaged by notebandi, and it was.

When Indira Gandhi cracked down on BBC,"Ramchandra guha actually calls the current times as undeclared emergency and for a reason.

You do more to hurt your argument than to support it by mentioning actions from indira’s time that match perfectly to Modi’s. 


Just like indira and the trade unions, Modi too has taken over government institutions like CBI, ED, election commission, etc.

Modi’s recent symbol has become the bulldozer for demolishing poor people’s homes especially the minorities. This is an exact parallel to Sanjay Gandhi’s beautification of the cities.

Similarly, We rank the lowest in press freedom. Every news channel sings the same tune and even NDTV has been bought now and the change in their tone is brutally visible. Even Nepal, bhutan and Afghanistan rank above us. Activists and Journalists are thrown in jails for speaking against their policies and termed terrorists at the drop of a hat.

Also all the income tax raids are strategically launched. There’s no implication of a routine or it isn’t a simple coincidence that they just happen to raid BBC after the documentary dropped. And BBC isn’t free of hypocrisy and blame but the contents of the documentary hold some truth if not all of it. Otherwise modi wouldn’t have banned it. It’s not like a mere documentary can be a threat to the stability of our nation where on the other hand you have sadhus shouting through speakers about killing muslims in broad daylight in Delhi. 

Modi never addresses the rise of communal violence and tension in this country. It’s actually the people of his party that are given all the freedom to cause chaos and tension and he’s willfully blind to it all.

Also dude didn’t conduct a single press conference in both his terms as prime minister.Modi is actually indira on steroids and some cocaine too considering how slick he is with maintaining public perception. There’s literally news segments spanning hours talking about the size of his chest or how he paused the ukraine-russia conflict to evacuate the students.

The above statement of yours sounds more like hypocracy because,

The home minister has said many things. He has also said Indian Muslims need not worry and there will be nothing against this. You are making your whole argument on verbal statements of a politician rather on what's written just because it supports what you already believe in. You are free to do that also.

My only problem with such speculations is people are losing lives due to such false fear mongering which is sad and no one is bothered to give a shit on that fact.

The only people who are going to be affected by this bill are ""Bangladeshi Musilm refugees"" and ""Rohingya Muslim refugees"" as this bill is intended towards removing or filtering them. If the protests are for their inclusion then it's valid and I take back all that I've said. There is no single agenda of the protestors and neither anyone knows what should be the solution which sounds more like a resistance to change rather than a protest. They are creating new issues of police violence as nobody's clear on what really they want. ( Assam protests of ""no ilegal immigrants"" is different and kindly exclude them from this argument).

You're absolutely right, they most certainly are. Movies are a piece of art and in as much as they can entertain, they can also provoke thought and serve in showing us a mirror.

However, the problem with these storytelling exercises is the sensitivity element. There's a good reason Benny Hill didn't do Schindler's List. 

There's a reason you don't hear too many recounting of tales during the time just generally referred to as *Gadar* because while part of our history, recounting of that time is just too horrific. It would be nigh impossible for anyone to make a movie whilst being objective over the entire unfolding of events.

These are considerable, paying the wages of every teacher in the school. Over 8,000 schools are funded in this way. However, although France has western Europe's largest Muslim community, only two of these schools are Muslim.

Even for private religious schools which Muslims try to fund themselves, they regularly shut it down by influencing labor inspection officers. Here is one of the investigative reports where interior ministry pressured labor inspectors to pass laws against private Muslim schools.

Another mistake, it feels like you lack reading comprehension. We're not a truly two party system, it's not BJP or Congress. It neither BJP nor Congress in their current state for me.

Do you know why Congress (which is by no means a left leaning party) and the intellectual left of India fails to appeal to the masses? Because of how to treat people with a different opinion. In the course of the couple of comments I've made, you have already taken an ""us vs them"" approach and have not tried to understand the point I'm trying to make. Instead you have gone on and insulted/made personal attacks.

> Kadaz dundh lena is now takiya kalam for many bhakts now, because they want to kick out or kill every last muslim in india.

> Fucking tell me when did congress want to do that?????

Instead they do it with other minorities. Also, Congress has an appeasement policy towards Muslims, purely for political gain. Pick any number muslim neighbourhoods and point out what Congress have done to improve their lives? Again, just because I'm saying RG lacks credentials or Congress is bad, doesn't mean that Modi is good and BJP is good. Both are bad, it's just that I don't have to list what's wrong with Modi here, so I'm not doing it.

Just because RG gave couple (don't be a pedant and say there are more, I know there are more) of interviews and sounded intellectual there, you think he has credentials to lead a country? He might be learning from his mistakes and probably has improved on the public speaking front, but if that makes you a worthy PM candidate, please nominate me, I can do both of those.

2. This example wouldn't be correct, cuz one Hinduism came before Islam. Two every Muslim knows Islam originated in Arab lands ,they Pride themselves in that .
Also that's exactly what the Muslim invaders have done, so many Hindu temples have been broken and grand Mosques built in their place. You are proving my point. 
Ever seen Gyanvapi Mosque? The mosque is haphazardly built on temple complex. Would you say that Hindu side should give up its claim to Kashi Vishwanath too?

3. Places of Worship Act still exists, so minorities need not worry.

4. I agree with your sentiment that we should seek God within ourselves. But there's a reason why temples exist too. 
They merely don't just house the deity, they are a centre of postive energy. Not everyone is capable enough to seek God within themselves.

"Vir Das - I COME FROM TWO INDIAS - at Kennedy Centre, Washington DC.","Your first statement is where the context of this lies and how it then squares with American example.

The fact is, Western populations can do this because they've dominated the planet for centuries now. They have institutional, socio-cultural and Civilisational momentum. Their polities are strong, for now.

And yet even then the paradigm mentioned in the previous comment about washing dirty self-affairs in public applies to all because this is a species-level effect, Westerners are not special humans, they just are in a different cycle hence things affect them differently in this cycle.

India is a weak State, with weak Institutions, weak contemporary/modern socio-cultural development, scarred historical baggage.

Republic era of Indian history is not that long when observed in long historical timeline of our own region's history. Statehood is not permanent or eternal. 

Actions have consequences and Speech is Action.

"An attempt to address the list of ""simplified"" explanation that is floating around in an attempt to justify the Citizenship Amendment Fact","The apprehension about a nation wide NRC is only misplaced but not entirely false. 
The very fact that you have to prove ancestry is kind of unnecessary at this juncture. Also, the other important thing one has to focus on is that the words ""religious persecution"" doesn't feature in the amendment. Rather the proviso says - x,y,z communities as exempted by the govt. in rules or orders made under foreigners act and passport act. So your apprehension is misplaced. Not entirely false. 
The reason being that the criteria of religious persecution appears merely on the order of MHA in 2015 exempting those minorities to get extended visas. Under the said acts. 
That order can be changed at any time. Without the parliament's assent. Meaning that the criteria can also be changed. Say economic persecution. Or likewise. 
So when the criteria changes, the people who will be getting citizenship will entirely be in the hands of the executive. Which is pretty scary because non Muslims have the blanket protection under CAA which says they are exempted by orders under the said acts (foreigners and passport acts) but it doesn't mention criteria of religious persecution in the CAA itself. 
This is what people should be educated about. My concern is most people I talked to on either sides donno much. And even though it is necessary for everyone to deliberate upon such a sensitive and pressing issue, it is sad that people don't do their research before that. This only reduces this debate to merely being a war between ideologies and political parties but not about how this CAA+NRC is utterly insufficient and unnecessary.

Wrong. Search for McCarthy. They went after the communists everywhere. The visa application to the US actually had a question on association with any communist party.

> They beat there opponent because they were better than there opponent.

Wrong. Until Ronald Reagan appeared, the US was struggling. It was under Carter that the US embassy in Iran was stormed and the USSR walked into Afghanistan. Ronald Reagan was the person who decided to compete with the USSR and began the space based defence program. The USSR had no money to match it and eventually came to the bargaining table. Ronald Reagan was the president who decided to arm the rebels in Afghanistan. 

Of course, in hindsight, that caused a lot of problems later, but your thinking that the US did not do anything offensive to the USSR is plainly wrong.

India needs a conscious policy to deal with religions who require their followers to deny other faiths. This does not mean empowering mobs like Pakistan does. This means sending a message to those who kill for their religion of ideology.

Hindus can't radicalise on a large scale because there are too many diverse ideas within Hinduism.

No other version of Ramayan even mentions the location of Ayodhya so it's hard to cross check but there's no clarity that modern day Ayodhya is the Ayodhya of old. The point is that it's an If. Besides saying that exact spot is where Ram was born is a fallacy, the Ramayan doesn't state that.

2. The example was to put yourself in their shows. Imagine if the roles were reversed. Right the Invaders did that, are we Invaders, are we egoistic monsters, are we conquerors. We're one nation, they're a part of our country, they're equal citizens. It isn't like the past where Invaders came and ruled and enforced their culture.
3. Who is going to explain or tell the common man about this Law? Putting that aside would they place their faith in the Law which for 15 years gave no verdict but when BJP was in power gave it to the Hindus. So clearly while Bjp is in power, it would be hard for them to trust the law. I'm not saying they're right or wrong to believe this, I'm saying this can most likely be the case.
4. It is difficult to find God within ourselves. Absolutely agree with you there. One of the key things in the Bhagvad Gita is Detachment and doing the right thing. I'm well aware that Temples hold a special place because you can actually see Bhagwan there and it's difficult to experience Bhagwan elsewhere but you're hurting people. A Mosque is a temple as well, it was burnt down to build this temple. Are we Invaders, are we Babur is there no difference between Modern India and Babur.",j4l2f79,/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/10ci4tf/rise_of_hatred_in_kerala_travel_blogger_and/j4l2f79/,3d4x4,-1,-1

Contrary, to what a lot of people believe the government doesn't function independent of the people. Sure, there are shitty things like corruption, corporate pandering etc. but those only exist because people are okay with it. 

We're a democracy and that means that the government focuses on the issues that brings in the most number of voters. What the government focuses on is largely defined by what the population wants.

Add these too:


On its website, JUH has listed various terrorism cases [PDF] where it is fighting on behalf of the accused Muslims. These include:

German Bakery bomb blast case (Mirza Himayat Baig v/s State of Maharashtra)

Lashkar Connection Case (Abdul Rahman V/s State SLP)

ISIS conspiracy case Kochi (State of Kerala v/s Arshi Qureshi & others)

ISIS conspiracy case Mumbai (Arshi Qurashi & others v/s State of Maharashtra)

26/11 Mumbai attack case (Syed Zabiuddin v/s State of Maharashtra)

Chinnaswamy Stadium Bomb Blast Case (State V/s Qatil Siddiqui and others)

Jungli Maharaj Road Pune Bomb blast case (A.T.S. v/s Asad Khan & others)

Indian Mujahideen Case (Maharashtra VS Afzal Usmani & others)

Zaveri Bazar Serial Blast (State v/s Azaz Shaikh and others)

SIMI conspiracy case (Madhya Pradesh) State V/S Irfan Muchale & others)

Jama Masjid Blast Case (Delhi State V/s Qateel Siddqui Others)

Indian Mujahideen conspiracy case (State vs. Yasin Bhatkal & others)

Ahmedabad Serial Blast Case 2008 (State V/s Jahid & Others)

And on it goes.

JUH has had quite a success in fighting such cases. According to this New Indian Express report, it has achieved 192 acquittals since 2007 with as many as 76 coming in last year. It has offered its services to around 700 accused.

Some cases where it got Muslim accused acquitted came not because they were found innocent but the cases fell either due to technicality or lack of evidence or because of poor investigation by the police.

One of the methods that it gets money is via Zakat, i.e. charity given by Muslims. The other is Halal certification.

JUH runs a Halal trust. By virtue of being the oldest and largest Islamic organisation in the country, its Halal certification carries a lot of weight.

JUH Halal trust claims to be “one of the most influential, reliable and popular organization in India"" which provides Halal Certification to the Halal Compliant Restaurants, Hotels, Hospitals, processed food manufacturing unit, Slaughter houses, halal-compliant products of dairy, processed foods, additives and ingredients, nutritional supplements, pharmaceuticals formulation and other Halal certification related services.

Halal Trust India is well recognised by most of the Muslims residing in India, Australia, South Africa, Canada & America and this is the reason why its halal certification is widely recognised worldwide.

No surprise then that when Baba Ramdev’s Patanjali had to export its products to Islamic countries, he also got halal certificate from none other than JUH.

Since JUH’s halal logo and its certificate carries a lot of weight, it charges its customers a hefty sum in lieu of providing its stamp. Here is its fee structure.

JUH is charging as high as Rs 20,000 for certifying a new outlet as halal (GST charges are extra). The certificate is valid only for one year and has to be renewed for which they have to shell out Rs 15,000 as an additional fee.

Every product is required to be halal-certified separately, which costs Rs 500 (see the fee structure).

Support to public causes by resorting to legitimate means of dissent like bandh, hartal etc cannot deprive an organisation of its legitimate right of receiving the foreign contribution,” said Justice Rao, who wrote the judgment for the bench.

As far as I get it right, the analogy here is the organisation is considered as of being political in nature.

"‘Bitta Karate killed us in open, he killed us in Delhi Assembly’: Kashmiri Hindus react, slam Arvind Kejriwal for calling The Kashmir Files a ‘Jhooti Film’","The sinners are Islamists who want to kill or enslave non Islamists. The other sinner is the government who very well knew about the nature, agenda and undercurrents of such community through RAW, but still preferred to appease them instead, to get votes. Another sinners are the people who are now using the word “jhooth” for the movie.",i262pcp,/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/toaux6/bitta_karate_killed_us_in_open_he_killed_us_in/i262pcp/,3d4x4,2,1
"""America's biggest newspaper The New York Times covered Delhi's education model on its front page y'day. It's a pride for India. Around 1.5yrs ago, another story was published by them showing thousands of bodies being cremated along Ganga; it was shameful"" - Delhi Deputy CM Sisodia","ahem ahem, 
lul This country is NOT backward. No one gives a shit about those white people who used to live like animals at times when we had huge civilisations. These people are pathetic and so are their opinions. Economically, India is not backward. It's DEVELOPING.
Dont compare THIS country with the countries that discriminate, genocide communities or the countries with citizens who eat literally anything. 
And if dirty localities, street dogs and cows roaming around is what makes a country undeveloped then maybe you could start considering every country as an UNDEVELOPED country. You just have not seen every place in a country to decide which country is more clean than which.
and about that burning of bodies 
I am extremely sorry i have no information about that thing i just realised. Sorry.",il68odm,/r/india/comments/wtrbbm/americas_biggest_newspaper_the_new_york_times/il68odm/,2qh1q,1,2
