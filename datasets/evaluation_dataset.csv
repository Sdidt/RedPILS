There are no proper college for higher studies, no jobs for highly educated people. Every educated student from Punjab either go to metro cities to work or settle abroad.

Former Diplomat K. C. Singh Ponders The Internal Matter Conundrum of The Indian Government,"I completely agree with you on the time scales and the need to rope in more people. Questioning wrong when you see it, is both simple and trivial. But the very fact that so many people are afraid to do even that gives a lot of power to the ruling party. If you want to see change, start with something simple. If one person alone does it, it's easy to suppress. If thousands do it together, it's harder. You cannot get people to stand up when they are so scared that they won't even speak their mind. I am trying to get others to raise their voice against what they see as wrong, so that as I am doing it, I am not alone. And I am not alone, cause there are many others who are very vocal about all that they see as wrong. That is why I say that India isn't beyond repair.

If the country doesn't like your speech there is little choice to change countries. Further they can put you in jail for it. Something which twitter can't do.

"ANI Do you know why China was able to take away a part of our land? It is because China knows that the person who is sitting at the top position, just cares about his image Congress leader Rahul Gandhi in Patiala, Punjab","This is exactly me as well. Except that I am a practicing Sikh and not atheist. Personally, I hate both parties a lot. To me, it seems like people on this sub are thinking that getting Rahul Gandhi as PM is going to solve most problems as long as he replaces Modi . The answer is NO. It will only solve half the problems but the Congress will bring new problems for the country. Rahul Gandhi is not some saviour. People only think that the country has become worse in only last 6 years despite the fact that the country has seen many ups and downs throughout the years. Situation was also bad in 1947 48, 1975 77, 1984 89, 1997 99, 2011 present. I'll be honest, BJP is doing things that Congress has already done in the past. Genocides Divisive Politics Corruption Oppression on Minorities Curbs on Opposition Lack of Transparency Misusing Judiciary Provocative Statements Kashmir The only thing that BJP still hasn't done are Fascism Emergency Editing the Preamble Indira edited the Preamble during the Emergency Period Nepotism I can only see BJP becoming another version of Congress. It's ministers are arrogant, Prime Minister is completely out of touch with the realities on the ground. Unfortunately, people on this sub are completely out of touch with the reality. This happened in 2019 as well where many were actually predicting a BJP loss. Either they will support the farmers who are protesting against BJP and at the same time, call them ignorant and dumb just because many of them vote for BJP. Nobody has talked to people in the villages and ask them why they vote for their party. I've seen people on this sub calling all BJP supporters as stupid, anti Muslim and bigots despite the fact that BJP voters are equal to almost 40 of India's adult population. You can't just call that many people stupid just because you don't like them voting for a particular party. A lot of them are centrists as well. You need to understand their reasons for voting for BJP and tell them why they are wrong. You can't just call them stupid first and expect that people are going to vote for the left. Both Right Wing and Left Wing thrive on hate and negativity. BJP is absolutely horrible but so is Congress.

There was no need for identification at that time. They don't call themselves Anglo Indians. I don't think they ever called themselves as such. Today's Anglo Indians aren't identifiable on any parameters because they are completely mixed in with the local culture hence no need for reservation hence no protest against the removal of reservation.

Everything is going exactly as planned to blame Diwali for pollution.,"Yes. It would take a beating, but it would survive. Hinduism survived so many barbaric invasions and colonial rules. And then fifty plus years of INC. Civilizations across the world couldn't keep out Abrahamic invasions, but India Hindus, Jains, Buddhists could. Both the invading Abrahamic religions are two millennia old at most but there were many civilizations in the world way older than that Egypt is mostly Muslim now. Latin American countries are mostly Christian now. Far out continents like Australia have hardly any aborigines left, it's a Christian country now. African countries are either Islamic or Christian now places like Nigeria have so many people dying each year cos of clashes between these two religions . Parsis fled Iran too. Perhaps Hindus are a rare breed who are so resilient that we prayed to Ram and Krishna a few millennia ago and still do, despite many incidents in between which almost made us lose hope of ever retaining our people, our temples, our heritage.

Rajasthan BJP MLA Sanjay Sharma posted this on twitter later deleted it,"Wrong. Search for McCarthy. They went after the communists everywhere. The visa application to the US actually had a question on association with any communist party. Wrong. Until Ronald Reagan appeared, the US was struggling. It was under Carter that the US embassy in Iran was stormed and the USSR walked into Afghanistan. Ronald Reagan was the person who decided to compete with the USSR and began the space based defence program. The USSR had no money to match it and eventually came to the bargaining table. Ronald Reagan was the president who decided to arm the rebels in Afghanistan. Of course, in hindsight, that caused a lot of problems later, but your thinking that the US did not do anything offensive to the USSR is plainly wrong. Again, nonsense. Why did Gujarat grow after 2002? Why did Muslims vote for Modi there? What ""radicalisation"" did Hindus there undergo? The problem in India is that the ""secular"" politicians empower Muslim extremists for votes. This needs to be dealt with. India needs a conscious policy to deal with religions who require their followers to deny other faiths. This does not mean empowering mobs like Pakistan does. This means sending a message to those who kill for their religion of ideology. Hindus can't radicalise on a large scale because there are too many diverse ideas within Hinduism.

Movies are a piece of art and in as much as they can entertain, they can also provoke thought and serve in showing us a mirror. However, the problem with these storytelling exercises is the sensitivity element. There's a good reason Benny Hill didn't do Schindler's List. There's a reason you don't hear too many recounting of tales during the time just generally referred to as Gadar because while part of our history, recounting of that time is just too horrific. It would be nigh impossible for anyone to make a movie whilst being objective over the entire unfolding of events. I'll leave the below from Deccan Herald's review of the movie But as you watch this film, it becomes obvious that director Vivek Agnihotri is working on a very different agenda. Instead of sensitivity, you get horror that verges on the caricature instead of tragedy, you get a shriek of propaganda instead of a human story of displacement and wrong, you get a laundry list of the pet concerns of the Hindu Right instead of a repudiation of hate, and an overriding sense of the colossal loss that divisiveness brings in its wake, you get an unsubtle incitement to still more hate.",i1yxno6,/r/india/comments/tmcun4/put_the_kashmir_files_on_youtube_everyone_will/i1yxno6/,-0.5

So saying that Muslims from 3 countries or for that matter any person from any other country would not legally be able to get refugee status and then sub sequently be able to apply for Indian Citizenship is incorrect. Also from the page of the Indian National Bar Association x200B I was also not able to find any correlation between the UN conventions and protocols with respect to citizenship granting from host nations so not sure how they affect this conversation.",fbndude,/r/india/comments/ebdeup/an_attempt_to_address_the_list_of_simplified/fbndude/,-0.5
"Buddhi Don't forget that the plea for banning fire crackers was first filed by an NGO named ISRN in 2020 and some of its members are BJP MPs and MLAs including Mallika Nadda, the wife of current BJP President J P Nadda.","Why are people so against the idea of banning firecrackers, and I've also seen many people who burst crackers just for the reason that a politician or a public figure asked people not to. Even if not ban them people themselves should understand not to buy them. Reasons you ask? 1. I hate the smell of smoke, and I don't feel like breathing just like when a smoker passes by me. 2. Many animals like dogs and cows are sensitive to loud sounds. To jo log kutto or Gau Mata ki raksha ke liye uchalte h unhe bhi ye support nhi krna chahiye. And I too don't like loud noises. 3. Know where those crackers come from. Majority of them are made in China. Un paiso se wo log hmare border pr Ptake phodenge. 4. Grow up. Diwali ptako se bnti. Diwali ko shi aur acche treeke se celebrate krna seekho. 5. Jis paiso ye mehmaan ptake khareedte h un paiso se soan papdi ke alawa ya better kuch dedo, dabbe khaae khatam nhi hote. 6. Now, Some people would add the point of kids. Well they obviously aren't mature enough so even if parents buy them they shouldn't buy a laaaarge amount of them, and also make them understand the real celebration of Diwali. 7. And those who are saying that firecrackers aren't harmful or aren't real reason for pollution, know the chemistry of those crackers and biology of your body. And those are pointing at crop burning, as far as I know crops don't contain any heavy metal. And is same as saying ""This place is already dirty, what difference is garbage of my house gonna make.""",itajwqv,/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/y9tb9x/buddhi_dont_forget_that_the_plea_for_banning_fire/itajwqv/,0.0

Also that's exactly what the Muslim invaders have done, so many Hindu temples have been broken and grand Mosques built in their place. You are proving my point. Ever seen Gyanvapi Mosque? The mosque is haphazardly built on temple complex. Would you say that Hindu side should give up its claim to Kashi Vishwanath too? 3. Places of Worship Act still exists, so minorities need not worry. 4. I agree with your sentiment that we should seek God within ourselves. But there's a reason why temples exist too. They merely don't just house the deity, they are a centre of postive energy. Not everyone is capable enough to seek God within themselves. The form of God we worship can be both nirakar and sakar.

I've collected all available records of UPA censoring free speech. Congress made 18 requests day to Facebook and 15 requests day to Google. That is when 70 of the country didn't even have access to the internet.,"There is a bit of problem in such situations tbh, in case of private companies censor, you have the ambit of law and the state to help, when the state decides to censure you, then you don't have much recourse. Just because a government was elected doesn't mean that people who voted for them agree with all their actions. Democracy is not just elections. In the present case, big tech actions ofc may be wrong in many cases, their power doesn't even match up to the power of the state which decide the policy and legal structure of a country. Take an example you choose to give away your privacy to the state, which may be similar to how an individual using Facebook decides to use it while trading his personal info. While you have made a choice on your own to trust state more than companies, remember many of us didn't. We don't want the dilution of privacy. This is different as to tech companies in which if I don't agree with their privacy policy I can leave, because if I don't agree with indian government policy, then I can't do anything because every tech platform here will follow the government policy. The founders may have political preference and they might not change easily, but their platform doesn't equate to it. Zuckerberg views dont matter much on how a user uses whatsapp. What you are concerned about is editorial actions of platforms of censoring or removing, which is why I say reform safeharbor provisions, which provides such protection to platfroms even they are doing editorial actions. Current action is using hammer when a knife was needed. Court orders are needed but such orders can easily be provided even for investigation phase before and if the situation went to a trial. Moreover, court order isn't needed much as a competent authority as per law can also ask for user identity. By law the competent authority is the home secretary, which basically means the home ministry or the union Government.

Rise of hatred in Kerala travel blogger and family receives death threats and cyber bullying from radical Islam for visiting Ram temple in Ayodhya,"1. In Valmiki's Ramayana it is stated that Ayodhya existed on the banks of the Sarayu river. Since we don't have a better source, this is the only evidence I can give you. The Sarayu river isn't in U.P, in fact it goes up to Nepal and then joins another river which joins Ghagra. Ghagra river is the one which makes it to Ayodhya. No other version of Ramayan even mentions the location of Ayodhya so it's hard to cross check but there's no clarity that modern day Ayodhya is the Ayodhya of old. The point is that it's an If. Besides saying that exact spot is where Ram was born is a fallacy, the Ramayan doesn't state that. 2. The example was to put yourself in their shows. Imagine if the roles were reversed. Right the Invaders did that, are we Invaders, are we egoistic monsters, are we conquerors. We're one nation, they're a part of our country, they're equal citizens. It isn't like the past where Invaders came and ruled and enforced their culture. 3. Who is going to explain or tell the common man about this Law? Putting that aside would they place their faith in the Law which for 15 years gave no verdict but when BJP was in power gave it to the Hindus. So clearly while Bjp is in power, it would be hard for them to trust the law. I'm not saying they're right or wrong to believe this, I'm saying this can most likely be the case. 4. It is difficult to find God within ourselves. Absolutely agree with you there. One of the key things in the Bhagvad Gita is Detachment and doing the right thing. I'm well aware that Temples hold a special place because you can actually see Bhagwan there and it's difficult to experience Bhagwan elsewhere but you're hurting people. A Mosque is a temple as well, it was burnt down to build this temple.

Their polities are strong, for now. And yet even then the paradigm mentioned in the previous comment about washing dirty self affairs in public applies to all because this is a species level effect, Westerners are not special humans, they just are in a different cycle hence things affect them differently in this cycle. India is a weak State, with weak Institutions, weak contemporary modern socio cultural development, scarred historical baggage. Republic era of Indian history is not that long when observed in long historical timeline of our own region's history. Statehood is not permanent or eternal.

J Sai Deepak's Advice for Indic minded students preparing for government exams Buddhi India,"I operate in an industry even more regressive systemically hateful of Hindus than bureaucracy, Tech, startups to be precise. Here are a few tips I use 1. Keep two accounts from two separate emails where your anonymous account can't be tracked back to you. It should be good enough to fool IG's algo that your anonymous account is never recommended to anyone who follows your main account. Never ever cross follow or DM from one account to other. This gives you plausible deniability in case you say something a little too spicy in anger. 2. Keep your main account generic, neutral and only post positive stuff. And when I say neutral, I mean not a single political post in 5 years level of neutral. Do not skip out on posting positive achievements of govt as that of India, Indian Science, beautiful temples, beautiful paintings and sculpture from museums, etc. Never cede any ground on anything generalizing anything negative about our country, our religion though, never. Feel free to label the other person a hater and bigot for doing it, you've built up enough neutral points that people will stay on your side. 3. Whenever I deal with an anti hindu bigot in business, there's always a 5 bigotry charge added to costs but still do business. Consider it a bigotry cess. How do I know the person is a Hindu India hating bigot, you ask? They are lefties, they post that shit day in and out on their Twitter, IG, FB, clubhouse rooms, just Google them. Lefties in bureaucracy are arrogant like that too, have close family in bureaucracy, know this first hand. 4. In personal conversation situations too, the rule is simple. Avoid all political discussions if you can, focus on the matter at hand instead. If it can't be avoided, reply with, ""am sure other side is just as passionate as you and they have some good points too,"" ""let's not be classist bigots and play down the importance of amenities our privileged selves take for granted like water, electricity, decent infrastructure, etc."" ""the natives here have been invaded and subjugated for centuries, they deserve empowerment just as black people and first nationers do in US and Canada,"" ""yaar, you're too political and negative, let's talk when you're in a better mind frame,"" etc. Always say these generic but, totally neutral and positive lines with a smile as a last sentence before fucking off from the conversation. 5. You personally need to sanitize your IG thoroughly, hey, feel free to delete the account and get a fresh one because it was ""hacked"" or something. Plus it'll help you focus on studies so you can actually get selected and bring about change from within. Remember, only with power can be bring about meaningful change. Don't forget who you are, where you come from or your values. Keep the fire of resistance inside you burning. P.S. If you Crack it and make IAS, do DM me, always good to make friends in bureaucracy as an entrepreneur",i1qz8nf,/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/tk7ayw/j_sai_deepaks_advice_for_indic_minded_students/i1qz8nf/,1.0

People who want to be politically correct may lie to you and tell you that they don't mind if refugees do that but no one likes it and privately everyone says such refugees should not be allowed into their country this is true in all the western and Asian countries.

"Indians living in USA, Indian Americans and US Citizens Please ask your Congressmen and Senators to hold Twitter to task for helping Modi cover up COVID19 Crimes","I agree that Twitter wont have much of a spine as they are a company with the goal of making profits, but a US Congressional House hearing on why Twitter is aiding Modi govt attempts to suppress COVID19 situation will be very damaging for Modi govt's reputation across the world. In A US Congress hearing against Twitter a US company Modi govt cant hide under their usual ""dont interfere in our internal matter"" nonsense. Let it come out , exactly who from the govt asked Twitter to take it down. Let it be known to the whole world what kind of monsters run the Indian government, where during a national red alert crisis, they are more focussed on controlling and censoring the news , rather than solving the situation. If I am not wrong, many Democrats have come out in the open to slam Modi government on various points, most recently on the farmers protest issue. However what is currently going on suppressing news on Twitter, threatening students and online volunteer groups from carrying out community help is a completely despicable act , I think more people find out about this, that Indian govt is threatening Twitter and preventing people from actually knowing about whats going on in the country, more Modi govt's reputation will sink to a level beyond which any goodwill that Modi govt has created in its foreign relations would simply disappear and Modi's govt will be seen as non grata. I think in asking Twitter to suppress such news, Indian govt hasn't thought about the fall out of such moves. Indian govt does things in a heavy handed way, but maybe this time they are forgetting that the world is interconnected, and COVID19 situation isnt just a farmer issue or or CAA protest, but a national healthcare emergency which is resulting in thousands of death every day, and suppressing the truth about this is nothing but unforgivable crimes against its own citizens.

I have no problem with practices that help children keep an open mind. Hijab is not that. Watching all women if a certain age vanish into that cloth in public definitely has a negative impact on society. The Hijab is a symbol of discrimination. It always has been. The Harvard scholar Leila Ahmed has shown how the spread of veiling lead over time starting in the 8th century led to the domestication' of women and the curtailing of the rights they had enjoyed previously. How could it not? Women may embrace the hijab in a neo modernist fashion to mimic the aesthetics of their faith while still being secure in the rights guaranteed them by a secular state. This is how you end up with the trad femme anti feminist crowd who wish to go back to the gender norms of the 60s. But they only do this secure in the knowledge that if they are abused, they can seek help. This is not our problem though. These decisions are up to the women to decide.

The picture pretty much sums up the ideology of BJP right now,Nazi Germany did many things before it hit the point of killing so many people. These comparisons of the BJP to the Nazi party are to the former days of the Nazi party when they were systematically disenfranchising the Jews and other groups they were against. And they did this by systematic measures and rules. Similar to what the current government is looking to do via these heinous laws. One hopes that such protests prevent the BJP from mirroring the Nazi party of the latter years and that such protests prevent such mass scale devastation again.,fbp9f6n,/r/india/comments/ee11sp/the_picture_pretty_much_sums_up_the_ideology_of/fbp9f6n/,-0.75

CM Kejriwal has a genius idea to boost the Nation's Economy,"For one thing, he's wrong when he considered Gandhi a politician par excellence, To quote ""Gandhi believed that politics had to be guided by religion which treats all beings as equal and removes excessive greed from life. To many today, deeply sucked into comfort seeking lifestyles, Gandhi may look impractical and too na ve for the complicated modern' world. But no one, not even his worst enemies, would deny that he was a simple soul , yet a gritty one, who became a powerful weapon to make colonialism history."" I try to be one of the few people who don't want to see Gandhi as a politician or a Mahatma To quote Guha ""Gandhi is impossible to classify in terms of conventional political categories. Was he a socialist, conservative, liberal or all of these? He was a true original. The left came to a belated recognition of the moral greatness of Gandhi, especially because of what he did for Hindu Muslim harmony. For a long time, the left claimed that non violence was a devious way to wean the masses away from the revolutionary path, but its attitude changed after what Gandhi did in 1947 for communal harmony. The right essentially dislikes Gandhi. It is profoundly ambivalent about him but instrumentally knows it cannot reject him outright. So it tries to make him more of a Hindu, assimilate him into a line of Hindu saints, but anyone on social media would know the Hindu right detests Gandhi."" And also for the genocide thing, Gandhi was with the Khilafat movement and when the genocide happened, he termed the moplaphs as 'misguided and ignorant' not because of any political leanings but because in Greek philosophy, namely Socrates, All good is knowledge and all evil is ignorant the same goes with the concept of Maya in Advaita Vedanta",itx572c,/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/ydqq7s/cm_kejriwal_has_a_genius_idea_to_boost_the/itx572c/,-0.75

Congress and Ayodhya,"Ok I stand corrected. I didn't know about the League of Militant Atheists thanks for pointing that out! and I completely forgot about the Enver Hoxha regime. As far as I know, most communist regimes in history have treated religion as a matter of convenience. Following the Bolshevik revolution, the USSR tried to stick to classical Marxism, advocating focus on internationalism rather than patriotism. But when the Soviets were reeling under the shock of Operation Barbarossa, Stalin invoked Russian patriotism, and a significant role in that was played by the Russian Orthodox Church, which was then granted various privileges. China has been actually meddling in Tibetan Buddhism, installing their own Panchen Lama as a counterweight to the Dalai Lama. Vietnam has also always had a strong Buddhist ethos. But even if such an extremist atheist leader were to emerge in India, would he gain any traction?

Washington, Paris, etc. Also, Delhi is home to 2 Cr. citizens of which 81 have voted in favour for statehood. We Delhiites are as much citizens of this country if not more contributing ones than the majority, we have the right to enjoy the same benefits as other citizens from their own respective states. 2.

What kind of dual faced people are you willing to bring to and keep in power in this country?

"""2 Judges Can't Decide"" BJP MP's Strong Objection On Same Sex Marriages","You aren't wrong to say that Hinduism is technically not a religion but a way of life and that some of the problematic practices we have now were corrupted by those in power. Since Hinduism is a way of life, I consider culture, lifestyle, rituals, and dharma as Hinduism. Not just the dharma. That is because unlike Abrahamic religions we do not have an absolute text but guidelines. So, all these factors constitute the religion. And that is also the basis for my comment. Regardless of what original intention may have been, the practices had, at some point, intertwined with Hinduism. These faults existed long before Mughals and British came in. It was exploitable and exploited before others exploited it. With time, we slowly separated right from wrong and will continue to do so, but not all of these problems were ""planted"" by outsiders. Given that our society had been practicing them for centuries before anyone came in, we share responsibility.

Former Diplomat K. C. Singh Ponders The Internal Matter Conundrum of The Indian Government,"Yes, I am. Being an atheist that's been one of the major points I use while pointing out the 'evils' of religion. I've shamed and slammed forceful religious conversions, destruction of religious worship places, and conversions on pretext of marriage without context . I condemn and speak against violence perpetrated in the name of religion and justifying it in the name of spreading the word of god. This is an issue of wording. The words you used tend to show that you're okay if hindus or any other religions are in the centre of everything. India has seen several mob lynchings in last six years, thousands of unlawful arrests, destruction of life and property of religious minorities, and violence planned and executed in the name of god. It's been one year of violence in Universities like JMI, AMU, and JNU, and I haven't seen anyone even accepting that they did it. They couldn't arrest any student in these cases because that's a part of propoganda and even after fabricating truths they couldn't get away with. The violence was perpetrated by the agents of the ruling party to help them mould a certain news, and they got away with it. What about that? What about Gauri Lankesh and other journalists killed by saffron mobs? What about people killed on 'suspicion' of carrying beef, which was never substantiated? What about professors lynched and tried to be burnt? What about women and children raped? What about animals raped? What about shaming and arresting an actress on possession of weed while several 'saints' get away with it easily? What about religious hatred spewed by political and religious leaders spewed from public platforms? Leave all them. What about the man who instigated delhi riots on national television?

Agreement by no means relenquished the claim on aksai chin. But allows Chinese to patrol the land. . Losing 1962 war resulted in LAC and further agreements allowed chinese patrols upto finger 2.

At Finger 4 area where Chinese allowed to patrol but not allowed to build permanent constructions. "" As Chinese allowed up to finger 2 and India up to finger 8, denying either party to patrol upto allowed areas or constructing between these two will be breach of agreement.

JUH has had quite a success in fighting such cases. According to this New Indian Express report, it has achieved 192 acquittals since 2007 with as many as 76 coming in last year. It has offered its services to around 700 accused. Some cases where it got Muslim accused acquitted came not because they were found innocent but the cases fell either due to technicality or lack of evidence or because of poor investigation by the police. One of the methods that it gets money is via Zakat, i.e. charity given by Muslims. The other is Halal certification. JUH runs a Halal trust. By virtue of being the oldest and largest Islamic organisation in the country, its Halal certification carries a lot of weight. JUH Halal trust claims to be one of the most influential, reliable and popular organization in India"" which provides Halal Certification to the Halal Compliant Restaurants, Hotels, Hospitals, processed food manufacturing unit, Slaughter houses, halal compliant products of dairy, processed foods, additives and ingredients, nutritional supplements, pharmaceuticals formulation and other Halal certification related services. Halal Trust India is well recognised by most of the Muslims residing in India, Australia, South Africa, Canada America and this is the reason why its halal certification is widely recognised worldwide. No surprise then that when Baba Ramdev's Patanjali had to export its products to Islamic countries, he also got halal certificate from none other than JUH. Since JUH's halal logo and its certificate carries a lot of weight, it charges its customers a hefty sum in lieu of providing its stamp. Here is its fee structure. JUH is charging as high as Rs 20,000 for certifying a new outlet as halal GST charges are extra . The certificate is valid only for one year and has to be renewed for which they have to shell out Rs 15,000 as an additional fee. Every product is required to be halal certified separately, which costs Rs 500 see the fee structure .",i0rlihu,/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/tepze6/suzanna_arundhati_roy_blames_indian_government/i0rlihu/,1.0

BBC grilling BJP spokesperson on censoring tweets criticizing the govt on covid.,"You didn't misunderstand. This is sadly the viewpoint of the Indian government today. And to some extent, this is how our governments always have been. People appeal cases like these all the way to the supreme court, and the supreme court does end up overruling the government and rebuking it for violating Article 19 freedom of speech of our Constitution... but by the time justice is served, it's often months later and the temporary bans have already done their job successfully. Like, over the last one year, these are the reasons and justifications I've heard from spokespersons of the government for clamping down on social media 1. Fake news even when it's not 2. ""Offending the sensibilities of religion X"" almost any minor criticism even legitimate of religious practices be it Muslim or Hindu is often met with hostility. 3. ""Inciting violence"" at this point, even someone saying ""we should flood the streets of Delhi and protest"" would end up getting booked under our IT act for 'inciting violence'. Whether or not they get convicted aside, the very fact that you can initially get arrested is a huge chilling effect on free speech. One incident that really stands out is the case of Disha Ravi farmers in India were protesting a new law, and as a part of the protest Disha, along with a couple others were making a shared Google Doc with common talking points, template tweets and hashtags users could share and some press releases. The government of India arrested her on charges of sedition because 'the toolkit was used by foreign actors to influence domestic agenda to incite violence'. Who were these foreign actors? Celebrities like Greta Thunberg and Rihanna. At this point... I kinda feel sad about how ""anti nationalist"" is commonly thrown around as a term for anyone who criticises the government. Maybe I'm going the other extreme, but the only day I'll accept India is really free... is the day someone could burn an Indian flag in New Delhi and not be charged legally as a criminal for burning it unless they violate fire codes or their burning it harms other people there or if they do it with an illegal accelerant . Extreme, I know. But the whole ""you're antinational and you can be arrested if you do X"" is a very slippery slope. We started out there people who burn flags, support enemy states like Pakistan should be jailed. And slowly, we've devolved to this.

The fact is that there are 2 different phenomena here. Painful throat vs losing ones voice. sore vs hoarse Both can occur at the same time or separately. There are different words in the language to convey these separate ideas. Here are definitions from Google... Hoarse of a person's voice sounding rough and harsh, typically as the result of a sore throat or of shouting. Sore of a part of one's body painful or aching. I would suggest that people using these words as synonyms are doing it incorrectly... But the recent trend is to say ""if people are doing it, that is now the correct usage and the modern definition"". If the people using it incorrectly have their way, both the words will soon mean the same and we will have to provide extra information to differentiate between the 2 concepts.

They cancelled low interest Japanese and IMF loans but took Chinese loans with higher interest because it was easier to swindle. The pandemic hit hard Srilankan tourism sector, a big source of foreign currency. The government did a demonization of chemical fertilizers to make Srilankan agriculture 100 organic. That stupid decision massively hurt the agriculture. Due to that the Lankan government was forced to import a lot of food grains which cost them a lot of foreign currency too. The agriculture problem also resulted in less production of tea and coffee, two biggest export items of Srilanka. They also pegged the lankan rupee to usd which was also a big blunder.

Another low for Punjab. Shiv Sena leader shot dead in front of Police. Source The Tatva India,"I think India should make deals with countries like Canada and the UK to drastically lower the number of Punjabi immigrants entering their countries and only accept non Punjabi Indian immigrants. Canadian and UK Sikhs are extremely radicalized and the Khalistan movement is mainstream in their bubbles, Indian Sikhs who emigrate there are very likely to become radicalized and indoctrinated themselves. In India at least, they are under our control, if they go beyond their limits, the police will take action against them, and the desire for Khalistan isn't as prominent. In Canada and UK, they can do whatever they please, abuse India as much as they want and they can use their newfound increased wealth to back and fund anti national elements. Then, ramp up security and intelligence operations in Punjab, raise Hindu and moderate Sikh voices and arrest anyone trying to spread dissent. Educate the Sikh populace on the shared history between Sikhs and Hindus and their common origins. True, but Jatt Sikhs make up about half of the Sikh population and they hold the most social and political influence and they're extremely outspoken.

How shameless do you have to be to display such inconsistency and hypocrisy? How are we, the citizens of India, supposed to take the opposition's criticism seriously, when they constantly destroy their credibility like this? Criticism of the Govt. is extremely important in every democracy, but those criticising have a responsibility as well. You can't just constantly say nonsense to mislead and confuse people to fulfil your personal agenda, specially during a crisis. What they're essentially doing is trying to create constant anti Govt headlines to build a specific narrative in people's minds, without any care for what they actually say. It's happened multiple times now another example is Vaccine procurement. When the process was centralised, Opposition parties attacked the Govt. saying that States should be allowed to privately procure. When the Centre granted their wish, within 2 weeks they shamelessly attacked the Govt for not fully centralising the process. They've turned the country into a circus. Usually, I would say this is normal for politics, everyone is always trying to weaken their opponent, but to do it during such a big national crisis, at a time when the entire country is under attack and needs to unite, is a new low even for the Congress. There are enough things to responsibly criticise, enough ways to point out genuine shortcomings so that the entire country benefits. Instead, here they are just spreading constant nonsense propaganda to further weaken the country at its lowest moment, solely for political gain.

Thanks Delhi For giving India some hope,"Desaffronization or avoiding saffronizining of the states is always welcome. But I have so many things to be concerned. 1.

And even if it did do it with nothing but pure love for country in heart, it's a sad state of affairs when the main opposition party of the country which is supposed to tackle the Bhagwa brigade is reduced to this level in the capital itself. 2. Vote share of BJP in 2015 Assembly elections 32.2. that too in the peak of Modi wave. Approx vote share of BJP in 2020 assembly elections 38.43. The vote share and seats actually increased. The Shaheen bagh vs us campaign DID work. 3. Leaders like Manish Sisodiya won by 3k votes. He was trailing since the morning. And he is second in command as well as the one who is given credit for educational reforms. This could have been a disaster. A loud phew. 4. AAP did a good amount of work but it can not be denied that freebies played an important role. Spending 1720 crores on subsidies out of 1790 crore energy budget is one of the things. How will it play out in future when there can not be any more freebies? So congratulations for today.

So, if we can get BJP in 2024, we have nothing to worry until 2029. And a lot might change by 2029 to solidify BJP's position further.",i1p91ft,/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/tk7ayw/j_sai_deepaks_advice_for_indic_minded_students/i1p91ft/,1.0

How can educated Indians be so uneducated?,"That's what the guy said though, religion is a bit too deep rooted for the common people, which can create unnecessary social division, an 'opium' which can only cause trouble. Besides, which country do you think this quote should apply to, in this day and age? Napoleon's France and most of Europe had deep rooted traditions as well and this quote clearly applies to them, why should it not be the same for India? Where should we apply 'such liberal thought'?",g2i65il,/r/india/comments/iek8ca/how_can_educated_indians_be_so_uneducated/g2i65il/,-0.25

"Modi govt wanted to ban PUBG, but realised youth will then ask for jobs Congress","The satement that pubg causes people to look away their unemployment ,falls in a logicall fallacy.There is data thar could say this but sadly data being matched dosen't mean there is a co relation between two independent things.The year Khiladi came there was a spike in number of rapes dosen't mean Khiladi movie inspired them. Sadly no,this isnt the truth,Taking away one form of recreation always leads to another form taking its place.Also pubg as a diversion form work and cause for unemployment is just plane wrong.Games especially games like pubg are played on good and costly hardware ,they have to be bought by some cash,this cash is either provided by family of a young one or someone buys it with their own money,the monetisation system is also based on FOMO this means game insentivises the player to spend money ,combined with the need for good internet pubg will at the minimum cost you Rs140 to play a month through the minimum expense you have to play for a 4g internet.This means the average pubg player is either taken care of by a guardian with no insentive to work or by someone who earns enought to spend on luxury. Also ,games have been tested and researched on a lot to prove wether they cause some harm.There is a possiblity of addiction and lazyness but that is true of nearly every non physical hobby.You can call your self a book worm and read twilight all day developing none of the skill same with games.Also game especially shooters are known to increase mental awareness,reflexes and attention to detail therefor a tool for increasing focous and skill.There is research that show games like league of legends are even more complex then games like chess. Also ,counties that play most games are countries that are some of the richest and have least ,Japan even PUBG is more famous in South Korea which is one of the best countries in this regard.Also games like pubg have made kids millionars and have given rise to jobs like professional gamers and youtubers ,jobs really not possible before. The only takeaway from this or ""truth"" from this is one failed government blaming other more failed government using thing that were not present in their time.With the ban hammer looming over every foregin app all this is giving is an escape to these stupid politicians to bann something and gain sympathy and goodwill because people find every anti establishment and calim that appeals to data true.withouth resolving the real issues like communistic policies,excessive red tape, bad education,illetracy and lack of policies to support small bussiness , wide spread curroption ,and really personall and behavioural issues plaguing societies that stop them from taking jobs.",fziq87o,/r/india/comments/hz9umz/modi_govt_wanted_to_ban_pubg_but_realised_youth/fziq87o/,-0.5

"An attempt to address the list of ""simplified"" explanation that is floating around in an attempt to justify the Citizenship Amendment Fact","I'll try to answer your questions, although I am certainly not an expert, and this is mostly just Wikipedia knowledge. Also I haven't seen the RSTV video you linked it's 28 mins long! All Ahmadis did not go to Pakistan, many chose to remain in India, where they are considered Muslims by law. Those that did go to Pakistan went for three reasons 1. the author of the Lahore Resolution that states Muslim majority regions should be independent, was Muhammad Zafarullah Khan, a president of Int'l Court of Justice, whose father was a companion of the founder of the Ahmadiyya movement 2. the successor of Ahmad, the founder, told his followers to support the Muslim League and through the cleric of the Ahmadiyya community in England made Jinnah agree to return to India 3. the Ahmadis were allowed to found a city, Rabwah, in Punjab, Pakistan, in 1948. These reasons gave the Ahmadis a false sense of security in Pakistan, but the religious persecution soon started, with an anti Ahmadi riot as early as in 1953. So, in short, the Muslim League pretended to represent them 'cause religion but all they wanted was support. Once they got that, they fucked them over. x200B Articles 14 and 15 gives any person not just Indian citizens equality before the law and protection from discrimination based on religion etc., respectively . Both of them are in Part III of the Constitution, which are Fundamental Rights . Any law the Government Parliament makes is subject to Fundamental Rights, and as such any law discriminating based on religion as CAA explicitly does is void Article 13 2 . So CAA is unconstitutional. x200B Any oppressed people, be it Palestinians, Kurds, or even Indians during the Raj, have radical elements prone to violence think Bhagat Singh, Khudiram Bose or Aurobindo Ghose , which both results from and is directed towards the oppressor. Once the oppression ends, so do the radical activities. The radical Mukti Bahini of Bangladesh stopped its activities only after they gained independence from Pakistan, in which India played a big role. As the most powerful country in South Asia, we have a responsibility to preserve the peace in our region. This can only be done by liberating the Rohingya, and with our help they will stop their radical acts, just like Indian freedom fighters or the Mukti Bahini. Edit Article 15 applies only to existing Indian citizens Article 14 is for everyone.",fbagu75,/r/india/comments/ebdeup/an_attempt_to_address_the_list_of_simplified/fbagu75/,-1.0
