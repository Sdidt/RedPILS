j0v0oyt,"India is a country with majority population dependent on the government for 2 meals a day. The same country where there is no absolute free speech, the government tramples down on the rights of the people by using blasphemy laws and other arbitrarily defined hate speech laws. The same country where police can arbitrarily arrest any person on the basis of just suspicion and even kill the person in cold blood and get away with it. Despite all these problems, the liberals want to prioritise LGBTQ rights etc. What is the priority folks? Liberals in India are just wannabe westerns who constantly crave for white validation to feel progressive . They need this validation to feel superior to the other ""backward"" Indians who they percieve to be regressive and morally inferior. Indian liberals will only become relevant if they push for more individual rights first before campaigning for LGBTQ rights. Allow the people to question everything, including religion. Only then will we advance as a society , assimilate and develop a decent temperament for conversation. I'm not against LGBTQ BTW, I just don't understand why the liberals care so much about this issue when the Indian state, since 1947, has treated the Indian citizens like literal piece of shit with no individual rights. Hell even the first amendment to the Indian constitution was to restrict free speech.

However, we are also the 2nd biggest contributor to the GDP of this country so by your logic, everyone from every other state should shut their pie hole and sit down until they start contributing close to if not at par with Delhi. 2. To your point of freebies. Because you're a victim of propaganda spread by a certain party of which most of this sub seems to be blindly fanboying, let me enlighten you to some facts. The electricity subsidy you refer to is only free upto 200 units, a 50 subsidy upto 800 is available upto 400 units and if anyone consumes even 401 units or more, they are liable to pay the full bill. Also please note, the per unit cost of electricity in Delhi is also one of the highest in the country. Hence, myth busted. 3. Statehood isn't some candy in the store that Delhiites are wanting because it is there to be had. Unlike any other state in the country, we do not have any reservation for our youth in our own universities. In fact, there are reservations of all sorts that take up more than 51 seats in our colleges and leave only a handful of seats for our children to scrape for. Put that into perspective with my first point about us contributing to the GDP. We're not just literally carrying many other states, we're also paying for our own children to be cheated of a quality education in colleges that we've paid for. Do you see how stupid that sounds? The same logic applies to government jobs. Just because you take the benefits of statehood for granted because you probably come from a state that has them doesn't give you any right to preach to Delhiites about what they deserve. Baat realistic aur unrealistic ki nahi hai. Baat manifesto ki ho rahee hai aur agar itna hee unrealistic hai ye toh uska vaada BJP ko kabhi karna hee nahi chahiye tha aur agar kiya hai toh just because they aren't in power at the state, they shouldn't block it just because they place shady politics and childish power games over the betterment of people of Delhi.

But right now, I'm not sure if the media were actually curtailed to not let out the news, is there a recent history of media dissent by the state government in TN. To get answers to those qns, I would have to read a bit. I might not agree here fully. If you compare the media in the US, there aren't a lot of crackdowns on media houses. A comedian Hasan Minhaj, Indian ethnicity and a religious minority but still manages to run a political show and has criticised the US government without a scratch on him. A lot of media outlets can use strong language against even their president, something for which you could go to jail here. I'm not saying we should follow suit, but there should be room for healthy dissent and the government should answer those qns. Also, opposition's role is to ensure the government is kept on its toes.

Although it isn't right to kill anyone but RSS members being attacked doesn't really makes one beg for answers or reasons as to why it happened. In contrast the bjp along with bajrang dal and the state police have been found to have direct involvement in communal riots. A recent example would be the Delhi riots where cops made some injured and unarmed civilians sing the national anthem when they could barely walk and later one of them died from his injuries and all this is on video. This is what makes it a fascist state. Breaking into a library and attacking unarmed students. When did this ever happen before 2014?

In most of the states, Governments have passed acts and legislations to take over Hindu institutions including Temples, Mutts and Endowments. This has enabled the Government to interfere in the Temples' management, practices and rituals. Not just that, Temples' properties and income have also been usurped by the Government. The most outrageous fact is that the Government exerts such a control exclusively on the Hindu Temples the places of worship of other religions enjoy freedom and autonomy. This is a clear cut case of systematic discrimination and harassment. From education to ecology and culture to charity, Hindu Temples have played a pivotal role in shaping the Indian society. Today's India has become a battleground for the clash of civilizations, and the Hindu society is facing an existential threat. The need to revive the Temple eco system is more important than ever. But this cannot be achieved without freeing them from the clutches of the State. The Government's control over the Hindu Temples is unconstitutional and immoral. Hindu Temples belong to the Hindu society and the State must exit immediately. While the state governments control over 4 lakh out of an estimated 9 lakh temples across the country, there is no such control over Muslim and Christian religious bodies. In this backdrop, there are demands to amend The Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments HRCE Act 1951 , which allows the state governments to take over temples and maintain complete control over them and their properties. There are over 15 state governments which control only Hindu religious institutions, specifically temples right from the appointment of administrators to mandatory collection of 13 18 service charge. This takes away the community's right and resources to protect its interests. This, according to them, is discriminatory as only Hindu community suffers this kind of treatment. It violates the concept of secularism. Also, the Indian Constitution does not permit the State to run religious institutions. Those advocating for equality say that the process of taking control of temple riches was started by the Mughals and was followed by the British rulers. After Independence, the Jawaharlal Nehru government continued with the policy of controlling the temples by enacting the HRCE Act in 1951. To the contrary, there is no such control over mosques and churches. We demand that in the same way, temples should also be freed from any kind of control. The government must amend the Act, which is the root cause of the problem, said J. Sai Deepak, noted Supreme Court lawyer. He also pointed out that traditionally also the Raja king does not have the right over the wealth of the temple. How could Indian courts recognise Sharia based Muslim Personal Law while claiming to be secular? How could Central and State governments take over the management of Hindu temples if they were secular? How could a secular government provide financial assistance to educational institutions run by religious organisations? How could a secular government codify and modify Hindu personal law?

The very fact that a person ""chooses"" to ""identify"" themselves with particular aspects of their ancestry such as nazi, or KKK, or other invasive species is of by itself evidence that they ""value"" that part of their ancestry. And a modern day german who values their nazi ancestry, or a modern day white person who values their KKK ancestry, is being racist in doing so .

They don't call themselves Anglo Indians. I don't think they ever called themselves as such. Today's Anglo Indians aren't identifiable on any parameters because they are completely mixed in with the local culture hence no need for reservation hence no protest against the removal of reservation. And you are comparing Nazi with Anglo. One is an ideology political party and one is nationality race. There's no comparison. If you have British ancestry there's no way to deny that.

jar42xi,"1. what the nazis did specifically to german jews lead to the extermination of millions of jews. what the gora not just brit, but also other caucasians did to multiple tribes globally lead to the extermination of millions of natives worldwide. 2. why nazis acted like that they felt they were ""superior"" and needed to ""purify"" the rot. why brits acted like that they felt they were ""superior"" and had to civilize the heathens. Yeah totally different. No comparison. x200B Unless you received special legislative representation in the german parliament for 7 decades since the death of nazi organizational structures. Let me assure you the natives of Bharath did not fight for and provide special legislative representations to pharsees who are also non native, but not abusive invasive species . It was the progeny of the nazi that fought for the legislative representation. x200B Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence. The fact that there are no jains shouting ""jai jinendra"" and destroying buildings is not evidence that destructive ideas are not present in jain philosophy. To ascertain absence of violence in jain ideas, one must verify the texts and understand them contextually. Most jains being peaceful is indicative of an inherent bias towards non violence in the jaina thinking but that in and of itself can't be conclusive. Similarly, the lack of protests is indicative of your premise ie, they have mixed up with the general population and have shunned the identity of their abusive ancestors however, it is certainly not conclusive.

If you are not in the special case covered by the CAA, you'll be subject to rest of The Citizenship Act, 1955, which lays out four principal ways through which Indian citizenship can be acquired Birth, Descent, Registration and Naturalization . Wouldn't a lot of people be eligible at least to acquire citizenship by naturalization? As far as I know, the 1955 act applies to every person irrespective of their religion. Only the CAA lays out a special condition for non muslim migrants from three countries, that of a reduced time five years to be eligible for naturalization. The purpose of the NRC would be to make sure that everybody tagged as an Indian citizen has the documented proofs that establishes at least one of the four principal requirements under the 1955 act, namely Birth, Descent, Registration and Naturalization. For example, one of the proofs would be something that can establish that you have been a resident of India for 12 years, so that you're eligible for citizenship by naturalization. My understanding is that it's not that hard to demonstrate that you have been resident in India for twelve years for most people. It might be hard for the homeless but wouldn't that be a problem for everybody? Including non muslims who aren't migrants? Because the CAA only applies to non muslims who are also migrants from those three countries and have been a resident of India since at least 31 December 2014. And even if you don't have documented proof there are other provisions such as witnesses or local proofs supported by members of the community, as clarified by the MHA Spokesperson yesterday . I think that people might be confusing the Assam NRC process for the one that will be implemented nationwide. The Assam NRC guidelines were laid out by the Supreme Court in 2015 specifically for Assam and as of today no official guideline, or process or procedure exists for the nationwide NRC exercise. So I'm not sure if it's right to be jumping to conclusions if we don't even know what the nationwide NRC exercise will look like.",-0.36111111111111116,-1.0

"" Feel free to correct me if I'm wrong but I do not think the act automatically confers citizenship onto those non muslims. It simply alters their status and no longer declares them an illegal immigrant but i do not believe that is the same as conferring citizenship onto them. In fact, they need to undergo the process to obtain certificates as listed under the newly introduced section 6B wherein despite being no longer considered an illegal immigrant, you would have to either pass the citizenship requirements as per Section 5 of the Citizenship Act as it currently stands, or the process of naturalization under the Third Schedule after which you may be considered for citizenship as per such certificates as under 6B. Note I am in no way supportive of the bill. I believe it is in blatant disregard of Article 14 of the Constitution and should be struck down with due time.

fbkiddm,"I am sure there are a number of readers who still may not have full clarity on the CAA and NRC. Yes, there is a sticky, but both the pro government and anti government rhetoric tends to develop their own biases and eco chambers. Where do we draw the line? Is the CAA and NRC worth the flak the government is getting? And why should one oppose it? Based on my own understanding so far, I am trying to draw an overall understanding of this issue please feel free to argue from any angle you may have supporting or opposing the Act or expanding on any points Background India is not a signatory to the Refugee Convention and is not bound to take any refugees whatsoever. There are a number of states that are currently facing increased illegal immigration since past few decades. This increased illegal immigration over the years mixed with apathy and vote bank politics by the relevant govts. has turned people hostile toward illegal immigrants in India. There were are no adequate policies toward settling these migrants or checks in terms of documentation etc. Decreasing job prospects and a fear of increased crimes and marginalization became a grave concern for the local population. Border being highly porous does not help either. Comes in a demand for more stringent attitude toward citizenship settlement and checking one's legal status in the country. It goes more complicated from here with a simple fact being that all parties Congress, BJP, and regional ones tried to tap into the people's fear and came up with various policies. NRC National Register of Citizens of India Overview Personal bias, but, I am in favor of it theoretically . I do find that India needs a comprehensive Citizens' Register. Nearly all the EU countries have it. Idea is pretty self explanatory keep a comprehensive register of all the citizens and cross verify their documents. Any new citizen birth etc. could be provided a National ID etc etc. Sounds good in theory. And document check might just weed out the illegal immigrants too. Problem? I am of the opinion that most policy execution in India is half baked and creates a lot more problems than it solves. In fact, it might not be an opinion after all NRC has been attempted in various forms since the 1960's. Government itself found the proposal to have an NRC in Assam impractical. Case in point introduction of Aadhar. Or demonetization for that matter. Problem II? This country has 25 of the population that is unable to read or write adequately. 70 of our population is rural that tends to have lack of documentation etc. I'd extrapolate anywhere between 50 60 of our country lacks proper documents. Note the list of documents and cut off date keeps changing. Furthermore, I fail to see any relevant post WWII evidence in any democratic country in the world where they asked the entire population to prove their citizenship. Counterpoint 1.2B Aadhar cards have been issued till date and 900M people have Voter ID card. That leaves approx. 30M people who may potentially not have no Aadhar or Voter ID for that matter. A well managed multi step document check might mitigate the fear of people due to the lack of documents. Counterpart II NRC is critical for the North East that have bore the grunt of illegal immigration since the 60s 70s at least from the post Bangladesh refugee wave predominantly Hindus , to Chakmas and Hajongs Buddhists , to the recent Rohingyas Muslims . The fact that the North East lacks the economic growth and resources only adds to the fuel. At least some step is critically required to solve the issue of illegal immigrants to the country. CAA Citizenship Amendment Act The Rohingyas Lets start with the North East and the influx of the Rohingyas. 40k Rohingyas sought refuge in India after the Burmese government expelled them. Burmese do not consider Rohingyas as their citizens as they consider them as immigrants brought in from Bangladesh during the British Raj. Bangladesh, unsurprisingly, is of the position that they are the natives of Myanmar and should be protected by that government. Do note that Bangladesh is now home to 1.1M Rohingya refugees. More importantly, both parties have used refugees for vote banks in 2015, 40,000 Chakmas Hajongs were naturalized as Indian citizens despite the protests by Arunachal Pradesh. Act what is it about? Members of the Hindu, Christian, Sikh, Buddhist and Zoroastrian communities who have come from Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Bangladesh till December 31, 2014 and facing religious persecution there no documentary evidence required will not be treated as illegal immigrants but given Indian citizenship. It also relaxes the provisions for ""Citizenship by naturalization"". The law reduces duration of residency from existing 11 years to just 5 years for people belonging to the same six religions and three countries. One could argue what is the issue with reducing the residency requirement for minority sects from aforementioned countries? Several democratic countries around the world have precedence where they permit a reduced time for naturalization for certain sects ethnicities due to atrocities committed eg. Germany for ethnic Jews during the Third Reich, Spain for Sephardic Jews expelled in the 17th century! Current scenario CAA aims to put a hard stop on illegal immigration asylum by the Muslims. Whether there is merit to it or not is a difficult topic between balancing humanitarianism which remains one of the core foundations of our country and ensuring national security. Proponents of the latter claim that it is easier for, say, an Islamic fundamentalist to pose as an ordinary Muslim the fact that India does not have adequate infrastructure and apparatus in place to ensure a thorough intelligence adds to the pressure. Counterpoint to above I fail to see how approving citizenship to all the illegal immigrants actually serves any purpose. Illegal immigration to the North East could continue to remain an issue and create pressure on local population. If possible, settle them across India but of course, this is not much talked about Why we should protest? On one hand, it doesn't sound so bad, particularly for the urban dwellers Governments asks you to prove your citizenship, show them documents. And guess what? With CAA, we are also mitigating the issue of illegal immigration as well to quite an extent. unless you are a Muslim And if you are unable to show documents, well tough luck you'll be scrutinized. One could argue that anyhow, we are supposed to prove our legal status in the country during the passport application etc. And that is where the problem lies. The scrutiny, administrative execution, and removal of a certain religion. A significant number of people may fail to pass this documentation scrutiny especially if they are from the lower socio economic status which, coincidentally, has a higher proportion of Muslims. Add to the fact that if declared illegal immigrant owing to the fact that they could not yield relevant documents, that person from Muslim population risks detention or deportation to where? in the country s he was born and raised in.

Sri Lankan persecution of Tamils was not a religious persecution. It was an ethnic persecution and there are refugees in Tamil Nadu and the Indian government has been sending them back to Sri Lanka after the end of the war. The GOI is building houses for them in Sri Lanka. Tibetans and Muslims one's an ethnic group facing ethnic persecution from a state. One is a religious group, having a state, facing persecution and then coming to India for economic reasons. You have a point with Tibetans facing persecution in China. But CAB doesn't have to include everyone. It's just a new path open for religious and ethnic minorities that are indigenous to the subcontinent. I don't think you get the point of being a refugee. The idea is that when things settle down, you go back to your home country. Things got better in Sri Lanka, so they're going back. Things aren't going to get better in Pakistan or Bangladesh or Afghanistan because they've declared themselves Islamic states and follow a discriminatory religious law that applies to everyone.

The CAA is ""inclusive"" in nature it's job is to grant indian citizenship to some of these illegal foreigners stripped of citizenship by NRC, based only on their religion targeted mainly at Hindus and ""persecution"" status in three neighbouring muslim countries Pak, Af, Bangla . The end result of NRC CAA is that ALL muslims , and some Hindus and Christians etc. will end up in refugee camps . But due to the stupid illogical selective criteria most of the non muslim refugees from Pak, Af, Bangla will get citizenship only because they were ""lucky"" to be born as non muslims in these country, while muslims and non muslims from other countries will continue to suffer. Yes, India is secular. Yes, CAA discriminates. That is a fact. CAA is highly discriminatory to ""other"" persecuted victims from the non muslim countries. There is no reason to treat a for e.g. Hindu foreigner from a muslim country as more special than a Hindu foreigner from a Hindu or Buddhist country. It is just plain ridiculous they are all foreigners and the victims or the persecutors religion doesn't make them special in anyway . The persecuted are the persecuted. They all feel the same pain, fear, anger and hatred. They are all victims of some kind of identity politics.

fbgkpqu,"India does not need this bill at this time. India's problem of illegal immigration is barely a dent. Illegal immigration is a bigger problem in western countries, and it took them years and years to implement a well defined system which still gets criticized btw as per which they will process illegal immigrants. India does not even have an agreement with neighbouring countries to process the illegals, let alone a system to register 1.2b people properly. Assam was a pilot project and it was a disaster with many people stuck in detention camp because they did not have the documents the government is asking for which is really difficult to get for a lot of people btw . And can we also not forget that just a couple of years ago we were told Aaadhar card is the most important thing we need, and we need to link it with everything. 6,000 crore was spent on implementing Aadhaar, and now suddenly Aadhaar, Passport, and even Voters Id is not enough. So, who is to say they won't change the rules again in some time. And with all due respect, India is not USA, UK, Canada etc. that people are dying to come to India because it is so good. Illegal immigrants come here because they are running away from something. Yes, some of them are bad, just like many Indians create nuisance abroad scams, fake degrees etc. but that is a crimr problem, and there are already laws to deal with it. Rest of the people are not a danger immediate or otherwise to India. But yes, they should be removed or processed, but as I said, there are MUCH better ways to do it instead of NRC. In 2016, we were told demonetization was an absolute necessary step to eradicate black money and fake currency. What happened? As per RBI's report and several BJP minister's own admission, most of the money came back into the system. And the promise of ""Give me just 50 days, and I will give you a golden India"" is something that was conveniently forgotten. The whole move led to many small businesses being shut down, and many labourers and farmers losing a lot of money, and there was no tangible upside to it, at least not enough to warrant such a drastic move. A country like India which is developing, should not be making sensational sweeping changes every 2nd year, it is a negative influence on the market and the economy. Illegal immigration is a problem, and certainly not what I want, but there is a reason many countries across the globe have struggled against it. It is not a problem with an easy answer. And in India, there are way bigger problems that we have to address than this. A government has to consider all possible consequences of a decision and weigh the pros and cons. Even demonetization was not a bad decision in itself, but it was so obvious that it was just not worth the effort it created so much chaos for very little returns.",0.2777777777777777,1.0

fbeeigk,"The apprehension about a nation wide NRC is only misplaced but not entirely false. The very fact that you have to prove ancestry is kind of unnecessary at this juncture. Also, the other important thing one has to focus on is that the words ""religious persecution"" doesn't feature in the amendment. Rather the proviso says x,y,z communities as exempted by the govt. in rules or orders made under foreigners act and passport act. So your apprehension is misplaced. Not entirely false. The reason being that the criteria of religious persecution appears merely on the order of MHA in 2015 exempting those minorities to get extended visas. Under the said acts. That order can be changed at any time. Without the parliament's assent. Meaning that the criteria can also be changed. Say economic persecution. Or likewise. So when the criteria changes, the people who will be getting citizenship will entirely be in the hands of the executive. Which is pretty scary because non Muslims have the blanket protection under CAA which says they are exempted by orders under the said acts foreigners and passport acts but it doesn't mention criteria of religious persecution in the CAA itself. This is what people should be educated about. My concern is most people I talked to on either sides donno much. And even though it is necessary for everyone to deliberate upon such a sensitive and pressing issue, it is sad that people don't do their research before that. This only reduces this debate to merely being a war between ideologies and political parties but not about how this CAA NRC is utterly insufficient and unnecessary.

The entire narrative of the opposition has been that ""freedom"", ""democracy"", ""secularity"", were part of the old India and not the new India, which is entirely false, and needs to be called out as false. Asking Twitter to appoint an officer within India is quite a normal request Twitter has no problem appointing officers in the US who have gone so far as to ban an American president, and many of his supporters nor does it have any problem adhering to European or Australian laws and empowering individuals working for Twitter in those countries to take such decisions. It is only India where they demand all requests from the government be sent to the US, as if they are not capable of hiring Indians to make such decisions. It is perfectly reasonable for the government to tell Twitter they need to assign local officers to deal with incoming requests. None of the other companies have an issue with this. Google agreed. Facebook agreed. I mean who wouldn't, this is a perfectly reasonable request. And no, it was not about dissent. It was about people spreading vaccine fearmongering, and people coordinating riots such as the one on republic day, using social media. The government has no problem with you guys posting things like ""modi is useless chaiwala"", ""chowkidar chor hai"", ""surgical strikes were a jumla"", etc, on social media. The only reason Twitter was able to create so much drama out of this situation is thanks to individuals such as yourself, and the parties you guys support.

I wrote in another reply that this should go hand in hand with education. But my central idea is based on the fact that the eligibility exam shall not be based on education as such. Even educated people fall for the most ridiculous of scams. BYJUs, etc A better way to explain my point would be the meaning of educated. Education doesn't depend on a degree. It depends on ability to think critically and make the right choice, having a structured moral compass, and not being blind to certain ill acts in name of self denial. In this manner, people with basic education, can chance this criterion. While this idea does sound far fetched, I would like to conclude with an example An uneducated village is promised electricity and that too for free for a long period of time. While this canvassing is obviously fraudulent, uneducated people, who have not seen these schemes before, shall simply accept how great the situation shall turn for them. Whereas a truly educated person can differentiate between right and wrong and make a better choice. The only problem would be to develop an examination based on such criteria.

Let us indeed assume that your premise is true I mean in a country of a billion people with almost entity of the country going through the SAME crisis lack of oxygen, medicines, supplies and irresponsible political parties conducting rallies in the middle of the pandemic , I think it's plausible that multiple people might end up tweeting the same thing. There are hundreds of millions of active Twitter users from India. Anyways, let's assume you are correct in assuming the text was indeed copy pasted by multiple different people. 1. Have you ever been part of a fucking social media campaign or protest? When students in my university protested against the administration for their tone deaf stance to student mental health, and increasing tuition fees last year, we setup a tweet campaign as well. One of the FIRST things we did there was to maintain a shared Google Doc with a set of potential tweets that people could copy and share, along with a consistent set of hashtags to use. One person tweeting alone does nothing the whole point of a social media campaign is coordinated fucking action. 2. This now leads us to two important questions 1 was the content of these tweets objectively false? No. 2 were they inviting violence? No. So if multiple Indians share the SAME tweet which is not fake news and which is not inviting violence WHAT DID THEY WRONG? Fucking useless.",-0.3055555555555556,-1.0

First , this is an opportunity by the media to take pothots on Rahul Gandhi for his barb on them about always towing the Modi government's line and it helps them meet their quota of anti Gandhi and anti Congress articles that earn brownie points with the government in power s . Second , Chattisgarh being a Congress state, is one of the few states where democracy still thrives and the media and activists can protest freely and more importantly be heard by the government.

I've a thousand things to do apart from being a spokesperson unlike you so forgive me if my comment was all over the place. Anyway, let's come to the point. I'll ignore a couple of comments you made above because they're full of shit. You think if you didn't intervene into Kashmir, it would have become Syria or some other extremist state. You're an idiot, I'll just say that and move on. Now, you accusing me of of being a Pakistani parrot, see that's the problem with you people. The moment someone speaks the truth, you just label them Gaddar, Pakistani, or terrorists or something else that feeds your justification of what's happening in Kashmir. Again I'll say, Kashmir was never a part of India. It was a princely state, the king made a pact with Nehru about Indias intervention into Kashmir to fight Pakistan incursion but it was never followed by india in terms of plebiscite. Every kashmiri today hates Indian occupation. They're the people who had been living there and it's their right to decide who they want in the form of government. That's called democracy which we don't see much under Modi government btw. Whatever you know, you learned it from Indian sources and that's not necessarily true all the time. No country would put something in their textbooks or acknowledge publicly their wrongdoings. For example, text books in Pakistan doesn't mention about Kargil and their defeat. Similarly, Indian text books will never show the true MAP of india, that's right the map you see is not true. India claims entire Kashmir as it's part but some park it POK and Akashi China which is not ours. Google it or look a world map by UN. P.S. I don't think you know the history very well my friend. If you knew, you wouldn't be arguing here. As a note, I would highly suggest that you visit Kashmir and see how Indian army treats all the civilians. Oh I'm sorry, they're terrorists not civilians right? Get your head out of your ass and just look at it as if you were a kashmiri, and hopefully you'll come to your senses.

i23r919,"'The price of diesel sold to bulk users has been hiked by about Rs 25 per litre in line with a near 40 per cent rise in international oil prices, but retail rates at petrol pumps remain unchanged, sources said on Monday. Petrol pump sales have jumped by a fifth this month after bulk users like bus fleet operators and malls queued up at petrol bunks to buy fuel rather than the usual practice of ordering directly from oil companies, widening the losses of retailers. Also, domestic cooking gas LPG price was hiked by Rs 50 per cylinder on Tuesday in line with a spike in international energy prices. A 14.2 kg non subsidised LPG cylinder will now cost Rs 949.50 in the national capital. This is the first increase in LPG rates since early October. Prices have been on a freeze since then despite the cost of raw material spiralling. Sources said a 5 KG LPG cylinder will now cost Rs 349 while the 10 kg composite bottle will come for Rs 669.' This is happening in Delhi due to which there was a sudden jump in the petrol prices. Why is the bus fuel rerouted? The LPG cylinder will definitely cross 1k well before year end which can be avoided by people through the use of pipeline which is less costly than a cylinder. Is Kejriwal making that promise? NO! Instead of freebies if he redirects that money into a project by which people would be able to bypass the rising prices won't that be actually better for people rather than trying to use tax money to subsidise something of lesser value he can only decrease prices by so much .

It charges Rs 20,000 for registration of an Indian company and Rs 500 for each product GST charges are extra . Then there is renewal fee of Rs 15,000 as the registration is valid only for one year. now what does Jamait do with this money?

JUH has had quite a success in fighting such cases. According to this New Indian Express report, it has achieved 192 acquittals since 2007 with as many as 76 coming in last year. It has offered its services to around 700 accused. Some cases where it got Muslim accused acquitted came not because they were found innocent but the cases fell either due to technicality or lack of evidence or because of poor investigation by the police. One of the methods that it gets money is via Zakat, i.e. charity given by Muslims. The other is Halal certification. JUH runs a Halal trust. By virtue of being the oldest and largest Islamic organisation in the country, its Halal certification carries a lot of weight. JUH Halal trust claims to be one of the most influential, reliable and popular organization in India"" which provides Halal Certification to the Halal Compliant Restaurants, Hotels, Hospitals, processed food manufacturing unit, Slaughter houses, halal compliant products of dairy, processed foods, additives and ingredients, nutritional supplements, pharmaceuticals formulation and other Halal certification related services. Halal Trust India is well recognised by most of the Muslims residing in India, Australia, South Africa, Canada America and this is the reason why its halal certification is widely recognised worldwide. No surprise then that when Baba Ramdev's Patanjali had to export its products to Islamic countries, he also got halal certificate from none other than JUH. Since JUH's halal logo and its certificate carries a lot of weight, it charges its customers a hefty sum in lieu of providing its stamp. Here is its fee structure. JUH is charging as high as Rs 20,000 for certifying a new outlet as halal GST charges are extra . The certificate is valid only for one year and has to be renewed for which they have to shell out Rs 15,000 as an additional fee.

Also that's exactly what the Muslim invaders have done, so many Hindu temples have been broken and grand Mosques built in their place. You are proving my point. Ever seen Gyanvapi Mosque? The mosque is haphazardly built on temple complex. Would you say that Hindu side should give up its claim to Kashi Vishwanath too? 3. Places of Worship Act still exists, so minorities need not worry. 4. I agree with your sentiment that we should seek God within ourselves. But there's a reason why temples exist too. They merely don't just house the deity, they are a centre of postive energy. Not everyone is capable enough to seek God within themselves. The form of God we worship can be both nirakar and sakar.

Most Vankars were college educated but without jobs. Post Nationalisation of Banks in India in 1969, they were able to acquire jobs in the 14 banks that got nationalised then. Ever since then, they have been voting for Congress, as they were able to afford a better life. In the past 20 years since Modi, the relevance of Congress has diminished in Gujarat, and most SCs have been fed much hatred against BJP by the elders, who I believe might have reason to hate him. The caste discrimination in Gujarat was high back in the time, not that it is not present now, it still is, but in a lesser intensity. Then when a person from the SC community is disallowed for eg. riding a horse for his wedding, or keeping a moustache, which are thought of as upper caste things by upper caste people, and then there's little to no action on the perpetrators, the anger against administration and the ruling party boils up. Now since Congress is irrelevant in Gujarat, the only alternative is AAP. As with every rally, people are brought read bought in hordes from villages to show strength. Who is the leader is irrelevant they know the party symbol, and they press the button. The newer generation of educated SCs vote for BJP as they know how things have changed and keep themselves updated on the ongoings. But that's a minority.

Anglo Saxon Protestant whites are no longer the highest social rung of American society and this is all a reaction to that shift in class structure. The three richest ethnicities in the US are Indian American, Chinese American and Jewish American in that order . Imagine as a white person growing up being told implicitly that you're the upper crust gentry in this country, your people built this country, etc. But when you see a Lambo drive by it's always driven by a Chinese. You walk into a store it's always owned by an Indian. In school the top performing kid is Indian or Chinese. Go to the doctor, lawyer or accountant it's a Jew or Indian or Chinese. Can't afford a house got outbid by someone from Hong Kong or an Indian tech guy. Literally in every marker of success in America white people are present disproportionately less . On top of that there's pressure from ""below"" with stuff like BLM, woke culture where white people are enemy 1 just for existing. That must be very jarring and frustrating for an underachieving white man who, for lack of other achievements, derives the bulk of his self esteem from being a white male.

Also the need for paid workers resulted in movement away from feudalism and the development of a working class. All of these events paved the way for the coming Renaissance.

All of these self realised sadhus that I've mentioned above stood against dogma's, casteism, ignorant thinking, blind faith, hatred and helped in developing scientific temperament. Have you not heard about Baba Nanak story where he taught a person that blind faith doesn't help you to reach enlightenment. Aadi Guru Shankaracharya one of the most known self realised soul who popularised the concept of, ""Advait"". He told the masses that the true nature of everything in the existence is oneness. And all that exists is nothing but the personification of Shiva. He single handedly stood against the ""Kapalika tantrics"" who were devotee of Lord Shiva kaal Bhairava form and were feared for their tantrics powers. All of them engaged in ""Dakshin Gami"" practices and were extremely powerful supernaturally. After Adi Guru Shankaracharya banished them from Kashi and Kashmir they dissipated to Bengal, Arunachal Pradesh and Tibet and Nepal where they taught Tantric Magic to buddhist monks. Aadi Guru Shankaracharya was himself a Bhram Gyani and knew ""Parkaya Pravesh"" the power to enter into the body of a dead person or even an alive person and in one case where used this power is well documented. Another well documented case is that of ""Guru Matsyendranath"" the Guru of ""Guru Gorakshnath"" who entered into the dead body of a dead king and started enjoying life as the king and forgot his previous existence. It is only when Guru Gorakshnath reminded his Guru by turning himself into a women that this world is a myth and he must remove himself from the attachments of life. He also influenced muslim who became known as Muslim Yogis who even these days sing about lord Shiva and Guru Gorakshnath. The sing Bhajans and tell the story of Guru Gorakshnath around the Villages they go to. Guru Gorakshnath was the same person who also taught Buddhist Tantrics and is revered as one of 84 mahasidhhas. Sant Kabir stood against dogma's, false rituals and casteism. The great ""Mahavtaar Baba"" is probably the longest living one amongst all these sadhus I have mentioned. He was born in 203 A.D He was the one who invoked Aadi guru Shankaracharya into ""sanyas"" he was the one who taught ""Sant Kabir Das"" and he was the one who was the Guru of ""Lahiri Mahasya"" as well as ""Shri Yukstevar Giri"" who was the Guru of ""Swami Paramahamsa Yogananda"" who wrote the renowned book, ""The autobiography of a Yogi"" Neem Karoli Baba inspired Steve jobs and blessed him with his blessing and told him that he will become very rich one day. ,influenced 20by 20Neem 20Karoli 20Baba.

Even the China situation fundamentally is a Political problem between India and China due to border not being Politically Ratified. Military is a sideshow in this.

Yet those coups they orchestrate pay off better for them because right tools right objective. Done and dusted, move on. Indian Military time and again has said about India China border, that due to differing perceptions of border issues arise. Well Military can't solve this and management isn't what they should be doing, certainly not for 50 years and counting. This is how resources human and capital get strained. Military can't disobey the elected Govt, fair enough, but if they let themselves get used like this, the rot was there as well.

India is a weak State, with weak Institutions, weak contemporary modern socio cultural development, scarred historical baggage. Republic era of Indian history is not that long when observed in long historical timeline of our own region's history. Statehood is not permanent or eternal.

If what he said was false, he could never change India's perception. People are free to come and look for themselves and form their own opinions. Vir das, or anyone for that matter, isn't stopping anyone from coming to India. After all, word of mouth is far faar more powerful than just the words of one single person. You say westerners can get away with it because they have always dominated the world. Yet a country like Japan, where the Japanese often criticize their country about the harsh work culture, is still seen in a positive light, because once again, they have more positives than negatives. We never see Japanese government trying to hide this fact or silence the complainers. And you say, this has to be done selectively and carefully. Where else should this be done? Who should do it? Who would do it? Who has done it till now? Bringing this to light to the outside, making voices heard to the people and place whom the Indian government cannot silence is a logical and good decision.

Oil prices and production have been severely impacted by the pandemic due to major shifts in demand when there was lockdown in most parts of the world. Naturally, a falling demand led to a fall in prices and logically any nation like India which imports majority of its fuel saw an opportunity to import as much as possible in this time so that it can bolster its reserve but they went a step further and kept the taxes high to earn doubly which is not fair.

And once that's done, Hindu nationalists will summarily start removing any mention of any Muslims who existed in India, at any point in Indian history. They'll be demonized and remade as villains to fit the Hindu nationalist agenda. Only after that, after sufficient amount of time has passed, will India start moving on to beating up the rest of the minorities still present in the country. Heck, people don't even wait they do this concurrently to beating up on Muslims in the country already. You're right that the analogy made in the tweet is probably not the best. But consider that the Indian govt right now doesn't really give much of a crap about Ahmedi's or Qadiyani's either. They're all Muslims as far as the govt is concerned, and their persecution is utterly irrelevant to them.

If you actually gave all the central universities the level of per capita support and institutional autonomy that the IIMs get, while also ensuring that their size is restricted to the numbers the IIMs take, educational institutions in India would probably be miles ahead of where they were today. Also, bad as the Central Unis are, most of the State Unis are in even worse condition. Just look at Mumbai University and the chaos they have over their hundreds of colleges and the complete lack of organization. Institutional autonomy BTW cuts in numerous ways.

And crazy religious nuts. So when we have pooja in our home they will say things like ""don't touch him her the house help because she is from lower caste and ask me to do work on my own while my parents are busy in their Pooja"". I politely let them know they are stupid and I won't move my ass and either they do the work around the house or the house help does it. But I am not doing house work because of casteism. I always help around when house help is sick or parents are sick as it's a humane thing to do. Once there was a pooja in our house and it was Saturday. Monday I had to go to some formal meeting and had given my clothes to a tailor. I tell my mother on saturday I need to go to Tailor and she tells me not today and I can go on sunday. I ask her why? She tells me we have pooja today. Me so what? Mother so the tailor is mommadon Muslim . And today is pooja. So I shouldn't touch him.

But when we have a Pooja my parents don't want to touch the House help as she he is from lower caste and the other example was shocking. I also help around house and am in general polite and caring but I am never afraid to ask questions or call anyone out irrespective of their relationship with me or their position. Our own parents , friends etc are castiest and racist assholes. Call them out. Have some balls. And the primary reason why they are like this is because of being a deep religious nuts they are and never asking questions. And meekly following whatever you are said.

g2k0s7j,"I am a Muslim too who used to work in a company with a Kattar Hindu management. The CEO was an Engineer who through hard work created this company which assembled generators. They had a partnership with a large Engine maker. The problem was the wife of the CEO was the CFO and the sister in law was the HR. These two bitches were the meanest scum you can ever meet. However that wasn't the main issue. The problem was there was a Ganesh pandal inside the factory which blasted loud bhajans non stop. OK. No problem I could manage that. There was constant puja and prasad was constantly being offered. When I refused the Prasad politely I was considered an arrogant troublemaker and snubbed. I was forced to work Sundays and work timings were 12 14 hours a day without overtime. When I took an extra day after Eid as holiday after taking permission from the HR she feigned ignorance about it and informed her brother in law who promptly asked to cut 10 days salary from the 10,000 month I earned. I was berated for going to Friday prayers even though it was for hardly 30 minutes and I would skip lunch for it. We received some sort of lottery coupons from other vendors and there were prizes like household electronics. My coupons were taken away from me and given to someone else. Later I heard from someone that the HR had taken them since she considered me an outsider. The straw that almost broke the camel's back was when the CEO ordered me to come to a trip to see the famous temples of Andhra Pradesh. I was threatened with being fired if I didn't comply. The visit was a horrible experience as since Islam doesn't allow idol worship I waited in the hot bus while the people offered their prayers. That night when we reached back to the office I was asked by the CEO to drop a young female employee to her house which was nearby. I was hesitant because I wasn't sure if she was comfortable on a bike. However she agreed and I dropped her a few houses away so that she wouldn't face any issues if her parents saw me. I waited and watched to make sure she entered her house safely. The next day I was questioned as to whether I really dropper her home or not. These accusations were cut short when she arrived late having overslept and explained how I had made sure she was reached safely. Funny thing is I was used to this sort of treatment by now and that is not why I actually left. I left because the company was painting old generators and selling them as new with mismatched alternators and missing sensors. As I was the QC Engineer I couldn't digest this and left in anger when the CEO ordered me to sign the QC release forms. I can write a book about the shit I had to go through in that company. We Muslims face a tough life in our country but no matter what we will not stop loving it. Since 2014 there has been even more aggression.

gir3lkb,"Trump supporters get all their information from an incredibly airtight right wing echo chamber that is completely and utterly separated from the mainstream news. The two spheres are light years apart. Trump supporters do not trust mainstream news outlets in the USA. They think the mainstream media is peddling lies and falsehoods, because they are all out to get Trump and destroy America. This is why Trump supporters are able to believe that the rioters were antifa. Trump said so, and Trump's word is law, and the mainstream media, as well as the FBI, and multiple law enforcement agencies in the govt, are lying liars who lie. This is not exactly the case in India. When Modi first got elected in 2014, right wing misinformation became mainstreamed in India in a way that hasn't happened in the USA. Republic TV is the biggest news channel in India. Remember how they spent months over the summer shrieking about Rhea Chakraborty and Sushant Singh Rajput. Vast segments of the population get their information from WhatsApp forwards, which the right wing has hijacked to spread their lies to a science. And there are very few progressive media outlets in India that are capable of combating the mainstream giants. The majority of them spend their time enabling Modi. Print media outlets have not been all that effective on this front either, and the few that do Caravan, Wire, Scroll, etc. are not widely read to really make much of a difference. The problem is much worse in India. The marked increase of privately owned media outlets, particularly news channels, happened around the same time as Modi got elected. And 24 7 news channels are how a lot of Indians digest their information today. They have played a huge role in mainstreaming unquestioning support for Modi, and suppressing all criticism of him. To use the comparison to America, it would be as if the whole country thought Fox News was actually decent and factual, and channels like Newsmax and OAN are respectable right wing avenues for getting factual information, rather than batshit insane conspiracy theory peddling shit shows.

Free speech is freedom from the government for speech. If the country doesn't like your speech there is little choice to change countries. Further they can put you in jail for it.

Just because a government was elected doesn't mean that people who voted for them agree with all their actions. Democracy is not just elections. In the present case, big tech actions ofc may be wrong in many cases, their power doesn't even match up to the power of the state which decide the policy and legal structure of a country. Take an example you choose to give away your privacy to the state, which may be similar to how an individual using Facebook decides to use it while trading his personal info. While you have made a choice on your own to trust state more than companies, remember many of us didn't. We don't want the dilution of privacy. This is different as to tech companies in which if I don't agree with their privacy policy I can leave, because if I don't agree with indian government policy, then I can't do anything because every tech platform here will follow the government policy. The founders may have political preference and they might not change easily, but their platform doesn't equate to it. Zuckerberg views dont matter much on how a user uses whatsapp. What you are concerned about is editorial actions of platforms of censoring or removing, which is why I say reform safeharbor provisions, which provides such protection to platfroms even they are doing editorial actions.

Obama was hounded on NSA spying. After which they had to reform and platforms under pressure reduced their co operation. An example is apple refusing to open iphone.

We also lack a strong judicial system to help in case of undue violation of privacy by the state.

Until Ronald Reagan appeared, the US was struggling. It was under Carter that the US embassy in Iran was stormed and the USSR walked into Afghanistan. Ronald Reagan was the person who decided to compete with the USSR and began the space based defence program. The USSR had no money to match it and eventually came to the bargaining table. Ronald Reagan was the president who decided to arm the rebels in Afghanistan. Of course, in hindsight, that caused a lot of problems later, but your thinking that the US did not do anything offensive to the USSR is plainly wrong. Again, nonsense. Why did Gujarat grow after 2002? Why did Muslims vote for Modi there? What ""radicalisation"" did Hindus there undergo? The problem in India is that the ""secular"" politicians empower Muslim extremists for votes. This needs to be dealt with. India needs a conscious policy to deal with religions who require their followers to deny other faiths. This does not mean empowering mobs like Pakistan does. This means sending a message to those who kill for their religion of ideology. Hindus can't radicalise on a large scale because there are too many diverse ideas within Hinduism.

Many animals like dogs and cows are sensitive to loud sounds. To jo log kutto or Gau Mata ki raksha ke liye uchalte h unhe bhi ye support nhi krna chahiye. And I too don't like loud noises. 3. Know where those crackers come from. Majority of them are made in China. Un paiso se wo log hmare border pr Ptake phodenge. 4. Grow up. Diwali ptako se bnti. Diwali ko shi aur acche treeke se celebrate krna seekho. 5. Jis paiso ye mehmaan ptake khareedte h un paiso se soan papdi ke alawa ya better kuch dedo, dabbe khaae khatam nhi hote. 6. Now, Some people would add the point of kids. Well they obviously aren't mature enough so even if parents buy them they shouldn't buy a laaaarge amount of them, and also make them understand the real celebration of Diwali. 7.

Answer Like Amit Shah quoted, there are so many universities in India and only few protested. Not all. Why don't you understand that, there were so many many many many peaceful protests in India in non BJP states and not all were this way? Also, not long ago, in revolt to the release of a movie we had people doing Violence and attack School bus filled with kids . Did Police Lathi charge then? Why now?

India is a country were millions of parsi's from Iran migrated 12 20th century , millions from afganistan during their struggle with russia , from sri lanka, from bangladesh, from Tibet China and now from Burma. Do you know that most number of migrants come to India from Bangladesh and Pakistan? Please read the Citizenship act of 1955. It clearly says who is an illegal immigrant. Any body who is in India without a valid passport is illegal. This new bill excludes the people in the 6 communities from being illegal. All Illegal immigrants should be deported. Now, every country has the right to decide who can migrate. For example, US has EB5 visa to stop poor people from coming in, other countries have point system based on education age, then there is something called 'extreme vetting' for people from select countries. If India decides to relax immigration rules for minorities of these three countries, it is not discriminatory but a preference. These three countries are not secular countries. These are Islamic countries where Minorities are killed. There is no question about it. Did you know that in Assam, there are more refugees than assamees? Have you read about Assam Agitation? At this point, people who are protesting and throwing stones and burning buses, should educate themselves. Being secular does not mean you should illegal immigration.

If you manage to provide the necessary documents you will be registered as a citizen and if you cannot for whatever reason, you will be considered an illegal immigrant. Since a lot of underprivileged people cannot produce documentary evidence due to having no passports, unlikely to own ancestral properties and birth certificates were not mandatory before 1989, they can be labeled illegal regardless of how many centuries their ancestors have been in India. This is how 19 lac people ended up being excluded from NRC in Assam and the central govt is well aware of it and that is how they probably got the idea for CAB. So, now, the same exercise would be done on a national scale except this time people of all religions except Muslims will have a way out even if they are left out due to being unable to produce documentary evidence or even if they are really illegal barring a few exceptions.

All Ahmadis did not go to Pakistan, many chose to remain in India, where they are considered Muslims by law. Those that did go to Pakistan went for three reasons 1. the author of the Lahore Resolution that states Muslim majority regions should be independent, was Muhammad Zafarullah Khan, a president of Int'l Court of Justice, whose father was a companion of the founder of the Ahmadiyya movement 2. the successor of Ahmad, the founder, told his followers to support the Muslim League and through the cleric of the Ahmadiyya community in England made Jinnah agree to return to India 3. the Ahmadis were allowed to found a city, Rabwah, in Punjab, Pakistan, in 1948. These reasons gave the Ahmadis a false sense of security in Pakistan, but the religious persecution soon started, with an anti Ahmadi riot as early as in 1953. So, in short, the Muslim League pretended to represent them 'cause religion but all they wanted was support. Once they got that, they fucked them over. x200B Articles 14 and 15 gives any person not just Indian citizens equality before the law and protection from discrimination based on religion etc., respectively . Both of them are in Part III of the Constitution, which are Fundamental Rights . Any law the Government Parliament makes is subject to Fundamental Rights, and as such any law discriminating based on religion as CAA explicitly does is void Article 13 2 . So CAA is unconstitutional. x200B Any oppressed people, be it Palestinians, Kurds, or even Indians during the Raj, have radical elements prone to violence think Bhagat Singh, Khudiram Bose or Aurobindo Ghose , which both results from and is directed towards the oppressor. Once the oppression ends, so do the radical activities. The radical Mukti Bahini of Bangladesh stopped its activities only after they gained independence from Pakistan, in which India played a big role. As the most powerful country in South Asia, we have a responsibility to preserve the peace in our region. This can only be done by liberating the Rohingya, and with our help they will stop their radical acts, just like Indian freedom fighters or the Mukti Bahini.

It is easy to write BJP off, however it is also to be noted that any momentum behind current anti farm bill protests is driven entirely by political parties such as Congress and Akali Dal. No farmers here have protested here of their own accord. Congress is supporting it because it is Congress ruled state and they have leverage here, and Akali Dal because the Badals have a major stake in the current Anaj Mandi procurement system a stake which some say runs into thousands of crores. Badals did not quit the central government due to any ideological differences they quit because they saw the bill as a direct attack on the oligarchy they've built while they were in power.

They have completely neglected and ignored Punjab from past 3 4 years and the business families suffered a lot due to Demonetization and GST Implementation. However, BJP actually never focused on Punjab. The answer for this is pretty simple Demographics. Majority of Punjabis are Sikhs and BJP's policy for Punjab was basically to let Akali Dal do their thing. They would get a fixed quota of seats to contest on mostly in Northern Districts like Pathankot . They are still politically active in almost all districts but only the Akali candidates used to be on the ballot. That changes now. But, the last term of Badal's 2012 17 was the worst ever in Punjab's history excluding the insurgency period . They freely let the Drug trade happen and even their politicians are accused of being involved in it for money. There was corruption, nepotism and high debts. However, the most defining moment was the Bargari Sacrilege Case. It turned out that the Akali's were trying their best to undermine the investigations and even 2 protestors were killed by police in protest. There was no way, they were going to retain control anymore. Also, their alleged links with Dera Sacha Sauda who are supposedly their votebank has also raised eyebrows. In 2017, we had 3 parties fighting for control. AAP had a new base but failed to capitalize on the opportunity. Congress did better than expected and won the elections. But again, don't assume that our people are ""fans"" of Rahul Gandhi or infact any Gandhi's . Most Sikhs hate them a lot for what they did to our community in 1980's. Mass killings, Fake encounters and the Delhi Genocide caused a lot of hurt to the community. If people had to vote for Congress this time, they did it out of complete desperation. Also, the Sikh vote was actually divided among all 3 parties. Most Punjabi Hindus did vote for Congress which was a big factor as well. The credit for Congress victory goes more to Captain Amrinder Singh than to Rahul Gandhi. Now, Congress isn't doing any better as well. Drugs are still a problem and Corruption is there. Things have only 'marginally' improved. But in the end, it's the hate for BJP and Modi that is making people vote for Congress not because they like Gandhi's .

gvx1if3,"I agree that Twitter wont have much of a spine as they are a company with the goal of making profits, but a US Congressional House hearing on why Twitter is aiding Modi govt attempts to suppress COVID19 situation will be very damaging for Modi govt's reputation across the world. In A US Congress hearing against Twitter a US company Modi govt cant hide under their usual ""dont interfere in our internal matter"" nonsense. Let it come out , exactly who from the govt asked Twitter to take it down. Let it be known to the whole world what kind of monsters run the Indian government, where during a national red alert crisis, they are more focussed on controlling and censoring the news , rather than solving the situation. If I am not wrong, many Democrats have come out in the open to slam Modi government on various points, most recently on the farmers protest issue. However what is currently going on suppressing news on Twitter, threatening students and online volunteer groups from carrying out community help is a completely despicable act , I think more people find out about this, that Indian govt is threatening Twitter and preventing people from actually knowing about whats going on in the country, more Modi govt's reputation will sink to a level beyond which any goodwill that Modi govt has created in its foreign relations would simply disappear and Modi's govt will be seen as non grata. I think in asking Twitter to suppress such news, Indian govt hasn't thought about the fall out of such moves. Indian govt does things in a heavy handed way, but maybe this time they are forgetting that the world is interconnected, and COVID19 situation isnt just a farmer issue or or CAA protest, but a national healthcare emergency which is resulting in thousands of death every day, and suppressing the truth about this is nothing but unforgivable crimes against its own citizens.

No. Many would move to greener pastures when they get a chance. Humans have been migrating from place to place since the beginning. Why is it such a bad thing to leave your country all of a sudden? Back in the day people used to stay in their hometowns their entire life. Nowadays, an increasing number of people leave their hometowns or home state looking for better jobs or better life. Nobody bats an eye because it is within the country. Honestly speaking, what do you think is gonna change if all those students stay within the country?

But people didn't just stop practicing, they applied the dharma with their times and slowly removed the bad components. We need to do the same but a common problem I see is people assuming Hinduism to perfect and needing no change.

I don't worship Matt Walsh or someone else, I'm atheist and disagree with him on abortion, god, gay rights etc. But it doesn't mean if I'm anti right then i will accept everything bullshit spewed by woke left like a sheep. Everything must be questioned no matter which side says it. A muslim guy talking about pedophilia, gimme a Break. It's mostly muslim apologetics who have to defend this practice frequently in debates due to their prophet and sunnah. What these ""western conservatives"" will do if involved me has nothing to do with agreeing or disagreeing with a view. It's not some tribal conflict, where you have to choose your own group opinion just because they are yours. Ideas are judged based on their worth and rationale not on the personality of their supporters. Matt Walsh might threaten to kill me but it doesn't mean that his documentary will lose credit because of it. Get out of political Tribalism. Now, you are talking about disability as expected. Go read the meaning of disability. Losing an organ, losing testosterone producing parts, is indeed a disability. But it doesn't matter, the whole premise as I have told before is based on ""my body my rights"" ""my feelings"" , ""primacy of self identification"". So, i don't think it's wrong with this standard to fulfill the wish of thousands of people suffer from body dysmorphia who wants to lose some body parts to make them feel comfortable and confident with their personality. Slippery slope isn't it. It's so convenient to mark something as disorder while other as choice based on ideology. By the way, nose jobs, boob jobs are just altering the shape and size, not removing the structure of a well functioning organ.

j8rbjkr,"How can someone actually in their right frame of mind equate Indira regime's emergency to a mere banning of a propaganda laden documentary. During Indira's emergency along with taking away press freedom there was a crackdown on trade unions as well. The Indira government reportedly banned trade union activity, strikes by workers and imposed fixed wages with no scope for bonuses. The workers that protested against this faced strict repression. Another controversial aspect of this period was Sanjay Gandhi's mass sterilization program across the country and demolitions of slums for beautification' of cities with little to no prior notice to slum dwellers. The most jarring aspect of Indira's emergency was Constitutional rights of people of India were suspended. Right to approach court for enforcement of Fundamental rights was taken away. Several of Gandhi's political opponents were imprisoned including LK Advani, Atal Bihar Vajpayee, Morarji Desai and JP Narayan. A mass sterilisation programme was also enacted by Sanjay Gandhi. All powers were vested in the hands of the Union government. This all went on for 21 months. When BJP and Modi remind people of dark days of emergency, it's the culmination of all these draconian acts which took place when emergency was declared. Modi ever since 2014 has never suspended your right to approach the Supreme Court or a High Court for enforcement of your fundamental rights. There has been no curtailment of press freedom. Malicious channels like NDTV, Quint, The Wire have regularly peddled propaganda and post Adani takeover sepoys like Rubbish who are on payroll of Congress have flocked to Youtube. IT dept has statutory right to conduct raids. They don't have to wait for the cover of emergency to conduct raids on suspicious bodies. These BBC are habitual offenders in tax evasion. Acc to a 2012 report, thousands of public employees, including those at the BBC, were not paying their taxes at the source. Report was by public accounts committee in the United Kingdom UK .

To this there is a simple counter, It violates the constitution which clearly states that the state will not discriminate against any religion, caste, sect that's the gist of it . And the bill act now conveniently jumps around this fundamental doctrine and also goes one step further by not including other states where Islam is not the prevalent religion Sri Lanka, Myanmar, China Tibet and others , the irony being those are the states where minority persecution is much more well documented and is further facilitated by the state. Not undermining the persecution in Islamic nations, but that's what the facts tell us. One more thing, I guess it's commonsense that a community would rise up when they see any regulation which discriminates against them however minute it is, which isn't the case here btw . So, their standing up is rational and can't be shrugged off as ill informed mob hysteria. This argument alone is enough to back the protests if we're going by the commonsense still.

gw62pih,"You didn't misunderstand. This is sadly the viewpoint of the Indian government today. And to some extent, this is how our governments always have been. People appeal cases like these all the way to the supreme court, and the supreme court does end up overruling the government and rebuking it for violating Article 19 freedom of speech of our Constitution... but by the time justice is served, it's often months later and the temporary bans have already done their job successfully. Like, over the last one year, these are the reasons and justifications I've heard from spokespersons of the government for clamping down on social media 1. Fake news even when it's not 2. ""Offending the sensibilities of religion X"" almost any minor criticism even legitimate of religious practices be it Muslim or Hindu is often met with hostility. 3. ""Inciting violence"" at this point, even someone saying ""we should flood the streets of Delhi and protest"" would end up getting booked under our IT act for 'inciting violence'. Whether or not they get convicted aside, the very fact that you can initially get arrested is a huge chilling effect on free speech. One incident that really stands out is the case of Disha Ravi farmers in India were protesting a new law, and as a part of the protest Disha, along with a couple others were making a shared Google Doc with common talking points, template tweets and hashtags users could share and some press releases. The government of India arrested her on charges of sedition because 'the toolkit was used by foreign actors to influence domestic agenda to incite violence'. Who were these foreign actors? Celebrities like Greta Thunberg and Rihanna. At this point... I kinda feel sad about how ""anti nationalist"" is commonly thrown around as a term for anyone who criticises the government. Maybe I'm going the other extreme, but the only day I'll accept India is really free... is the day someone could burn an Indian flag in New Delhi and not be charged legally as a criminal for burning it unless they violate fire codes or their burning it harms other people there or if they do it with an illegal accelerant . Extreme, I know. But the whole ""you're antinational and you can be arrested if you do X"" is a very slippery slope.

Instead of Ab ki bar modi Sarkar, it has to be anyone but Modi. And if we are looking for leaders, you have good leaders in Kejriwal and Naveen Patnaik. Kejriwal has done good work in delhi. It's a different thing that the centre is clipping his wings at every point. Delhiites swear by how he won the majority in the last 2 elections. As for mr Patnaik his credentials go a long way. He has shown expert leadership in managing the cyclone crisis that hits his states every year. The death tolls are negligible. And I just read an article on India Today on how Orissa is expertly handling the 2nd wave and sending oxygen to other states. So yes, we do have leaders and options. But then the biggest question is how much clout can these regional leaders get before the 2024 elections to stand up against the national juggernaut that BJP has become. Either ways.

I am not an active Redditor who comments on posts or stuff. But today I chose to change that because I felt the need to do so. If my comment can touch even 5 people who decide that enough is enough and we need change, I will continue to comment and post where I find it necessary. Hopefully if all of us can collectively discuss such issues on SM, with our friends, attack those mind f ked bhakts with facts, I think we can get there. But it has to start now. We have less than 3 years to the General elections. It's important that we make the right noise now rather than wait for 2024 for this political party to play a new trick along the lines of patriotism or religion to come to power. I am not a congress supporter. Most of us aren't, but the other day I saw a video post about RaGa talking about the covid wave in 2020 as a tsunami and how elected officials were ridiculing him. And in that video you had the comment from Delhi HC which noted that the second wave is a tsunami in 2021. I am not giving RaGa credit where he doesn't deserve, but I would laud that post for recognising his comment and highlighting it. Similarly, I would laud each one of us who are taking the time out to criticise and hold the current regime accountable for the current crises. Most of us didn't speak up against the govt earlier. We turned a blind eye when students were harassed during the JNU issue and anti CAA protests. But now this was the breaking point. What's important is that we maintain the flow and ask the right questions. I am hopeful that we can bring about change. Even if BJP win in 2024. It's important that we have strong opposition numbers in both houses. I guess we can't control RS directly, but LS we can. So let's make that happen as a worse case scenario",-0.8611111111111112,-1.0

Sadly no,this isnt the truth,Taking away one form of recreation always leads to another form taking its place.Also pubg as a diversion form work and cause for unemployment is just plane wrong.Games especially games like pubg are played on good and costly hardware ,they have to be bought by some cash,this cash is either provided by family of a young one or someone buys it with their own money,the monetisation system is also based on FOMO this means game insentivises the player to spend money ,combined with the need for good internet pubg will at the minimum cost you Rs140 to play a month through the minimum expense you have to play for a 4g internet.This means the average pubg player is either taken care of by a guardian with no insentive to work or by someone who earns enought to spend on luxury. Also ,games have been tested and researched on a lot to prove wether they cause some harm.There is a possiblity of addiction and lazyness but that is true of nearly every non physical hobby.You can call your self a book worm and read twilight all day developing none of the skill same with games.Also game especially shooters are known to increase mental awareness,reflexes and attention to detail therefor a tool for increasing focous and skill.There is research that show games like league of legends are even more complex then games like chess.

fzlim72,"I wholeheartedly disagree. There is a few layers of logical leaps in your comment that I won't go into, because they aren't relevant to this topic here, so I am just going to focus on the time bit and the addiction bit. There's no objective measure on what's the best way of spending your time, because it really differs for everyone under different contexts. Some people choose to spend time playing video games because that's the most practical and cheapest option they have for acquiring entertainment some do it because they find consolation in doing so some others do it because it's the only way for them to mentally escape from a dire situation they are in. I happen to know a terminal cancer patient who did just that... how would you instruct a person who has only a few weeks to a month of lifetime left, who is too weak to do actually anything, and is already surrounded by family members, to not lose the most precious thing in the universe so that she could best spend her time? This is an extreme example, but it illustrates my point perfectly what your definition of best use of time and values are only as relevant as to the person having to deal with all the factors in life as you do, which is your own self when you unpack the details, your understanding applies to far fewer people than you imagine. To use myself as a personal example, I choose to play video games because it's objectively the most convenient way for me to unwind after a day or parental and professional duty, especially that I am a pretend extrovert who actually finds social occasions exhausting I can just take two hours for myself, engage my mind fully on a game that I appreciate, and offset the stress that I accumulated during the day. Some video games can be drugs if the user is not careful in how they consume, but many video games offer an insightful, meaningful, and or rewarding experience without the players becoming hooked just because there are many commercial games that can lead to addiction, it doesn't mean all games can lead to addiction. To use a different analogy just because there are people who drink drive, or die of alcohol intoxication, and get involved in violence issues caused by alcohols, it doesn't automatically make alcohols bad. This is where I meant you took too many logical leaps, and I'd suggest this reading list for you to go through to understand where you fell trap to your own biases. Don't believe me? Go check out a game called GRIS that game is a work of fine art, and I would be hard pressed to find someone that actually who enjoys it that also actually becomes addicted to it.

They don't hold any power to bring the government to justice in any way, shape or form as long as the majority is happy with who they elected to govern rule the country. The majority will buy into whatever narrative they spin and won't need any proof at all. Rest will demand proof but they can't do anything even if they themselves produce proof of fraud. The only institution that they could rely on The Supreme Court doesn't seem to be independent either anymore looking back, was it ever? x200B There are only two ways back from here to restoring whatever values at least on paper the country had. x200B 1. This government destroys the country to such an extent that people finally see them for what they are like the fascists in Italy, Spain and Germany or the communists in eastern Europe. 2. Somehow the opposition manages to bring the majority of the people around makes them see how they are being manipulated and their religious sentiments taken advantage of. How they've been turned into this insecure majority whose only purpose has become fighting the minorities and opposition instead of demanding healthcare, education, jobs and rights. There is a 3rd possibility as well. A future where the government actually manages to achieve some or most goals in improving people's lives. Where they manage raise the quality of life across the country and bring people out of poverty. Where cities become global economic power houses and rural regions flourish with agriculture, handicrafts and small industry. However, this requires an actual competent and educated government. A government that is comprised of scientists, thinkers and intellectuals, not one where priests and 8th grade pass outs are allowed to run states and countries. In a way, we are fortunate that there aren't any actual intellectuals capable of actually make progress present in the government cause a competent government with fascist tendencies is far more dangerous than a foolish uneducated religious one in the long run but then again, I guess bigotry and religious fundamentalism tends to be inversely proportional to education and intellect. The more someone reads, learns and understand the world, the less bigoted and close minded they tend to become.

Also such incidents are a blot to his image and future ministerial positions , small state , such things matter In my state , no one can kill a journo like that , things got escalated to physical because of kamal shukla's articles , MLA's man were pissed off bcoz of those articles , ground workers don't have much brain. Congress has responded decently well , it created a huge ruckus in media . Small peaceful state such things matter a lot here . The message has been sent to not even touch rough up journos.

Winter months see some of the worst air pollution levels in Delhi. We find that Diwali, on average, leads to increasing pollution levels across all locations in Delhi. Over a period of two days, Diwali adds about 40 g m to PM 2.5 particulate concentration. While this number may look small in itself, it is high considering the already poor air quality around the time. There is a wide variation in the effect of firecrackers across locations. It is further important to study the contribution of firecrackers relative to vehicles at the same time. We hope to address this in future research.As discussed earlier, it is possible that the bad air that we see in Delhi at the time of Diwali is just the bad air quality in winter, and is not causally impacted upon by Diwali.

What is more is, even from the amount donated only 350K has been donated by Heard herself. Rest of it was either donated by Musk or Depp. Quoting RollingStone To date, the ACLU has credited Heard with donating 1.3 million, though most of that appears to have been made by Musk and 100,000 came via Depp, testimony showed.

Keep two accounts from two separate emails where your anonymous account can't be tracked back to you. It should be good enough to fool IG's algo that your anonymous account is never recommended to anyone who follows your main account. Never ever cross follow or DM from one account to other. This gives you plausible deniability in case you say something a little too spicy in anger. 2. Keep your main account generic, neutral and only post positive stuff. And when I say neutral, I mean not a single political post in 5 years level of neutral. Do not skip out on posting positive achievements of govt as that of India, Indian Science, beautiful temples, beautiful paintings and sculpture from museums, etc. Never cede any ground on anything generalizing anything negative about our country, our religion though, never. Feel free to label the other person a hater and bigot for doing it, you've built up enough neutral points that people will stay on your side. 3. Whenever I deal with an anti hindu bigot in business, there's always a 5 bigotry charge added to costs but still do business. Consider it a bigotry cess. How do I know the person is a Hindu India hating bigot, you ask? They are lefties, they post that shit day in and out on their Twitter, IG, FB, clubhouse rooms, just Google them. Lefties in bureaucracy are arrogant like that too, have close family in bureaucracy, know this first hand. 4. In personal conversation situations too, the rule is simple. Avoid all political discussions if you can, focus on the matter at hand instead. If it can't be avoided, reply with, ""am sure other side is just as passionate as you and they have some good points too,"" ""let's not be classist bigots and play down the importance of amenities our privileged selves take for granted like water, electricity, decent infrastructure, etc."" ""the natives here have been invaded and subjugated for centuries, they deserve empowerment just as black people and first nationers do in US and Canada,"" ""yaar, you're too political and negative, let's talk when you're in a better mind frame,"" etc. Always say these generic but, totally neutral and positive lines with a smile as a last sentence before fucking off from the conversation. 5. You personally need to sanitize your IG thoroughly, hey, feel free to delete the account and get a fresh one because it was ""hacked"" or something. Plus it'll help you focus on studies so you can actually get selected and bring about change from within. Remember, only with power can be bring about meaningful change.

But no one, not even his worst enemies, would deny that he was a simple soul , yet a gritty one, who became a powerful weapon to make colonialism history."" I try to be one of the few people who don't want to see Gandhi as a politician or a Mahatma To quote Guha ""Gandhi is impossible to classify in terms of conventional political categories. Was he a socialist, conservative, liberal or all of these? He was a true original. The left came to a belated recognition of the moral greatness of Gandhi, especially because of what he did for Hindu Muslim harmony. For a long time, the left claimed that non violence was a devious way to wean the masses away from the revolutionary path, but its attitude changed after what Gandhi did in 1947 for communal harmony. The right essentially dislikes Gandhi. It is profoundly ambivalent about him but instrumentally knows it cannot reject him outright. So it tries to make him more of a Hindu, assimilate him into a line of Hindu saints, but anyone on social media would know the Hindu right detests Gandhi."" And also for the genocide thing, Gandhi was with the Khilafat movement and when the genocide happened, he termed the moplaphs as 'misguided and ignorant' not because of any political leanings but because in Greek philosophy, namely Socrates, All good is knowledge and all evil is ignorant the same goes with the concept of Maya in Advaita Vedanta",0.7222222222222223,1.0

Patients are in fact, strongly encouraged to continue their treatment. As with serious medical cases, 20 30 of people do heal. When these people heal, these people approach the family and say Jesus has heard your prayers, so now convert if you have an inch of gratitude towards Jesus.

How are we, the citizens of India, supposed to take the opposition's criticism seriously, when they constantly destroy their credibility like this? Criticism of the Govt. is extremely important in every democracy, but those criticising have a responsibility as well. You can't just constantly say nonsense to mislead and confuse people to fulfil your personal agenda, specially during a crisis. What they're essentially doing is trying to create constant anti Govt headlines to build a specific narrative in people's minds, without any care for what they actually say. It's happened multiple times now another example is Vaccine procurement. When the process was centralised, Opposition parties attacked the Govt. saying that States should be allowed to privately procure. When the Centre granted their wish, within 2 weeks they shamelessly attacked the Govt for not fully centralising the process. They've turned the country into a circus. Usually, I would say this is normal for politics, everyone is always trying to weaken their opponent, but to do it during such a big national crisis, at a time when the entire country is under attack and needs to unite, is a new low even for the Congress.

j4l2f79,"1. In Valmiki's Ramayana it is stated that Ayodhya existed on the banks of the Sarayu river. Since we don't have a better source, this is the only evidence I can give you. The Sarayu river isn't in U.P, in fact it goes up to Nepal and then joins another river which joins Ghagra. Ghagra river is the one which makes it to Ayodhya. No other version of Ramayan even mentions the location of Ayodhya so it's hard to cross check but there's no clarity that modern day Ayodhya is the Ayodhya of old. The point is that it's an If. Besides saying that exact spot is where Ram was born is a fallacy, the Ramayan doesn't state that. 2. The example was to put yourself in their shows. Imagine if the roles were reversed. Right the Invaders did that, are we Invaders, are we egoistic monsters, are we conquerors. We're one nation, they're a part of our country, they're equal citizens. It isn't like the past where Invaders came and ruled and enforced their culture. 3. Who is going to explain or tell the common man about this Law? Putting that aside would they place their faith in the Law which for 15 years gave no verdict but when BJP was in power gave it to the Hindus. So clearly while Bjp is in power, it would be hard for them to trust the law. I'm not saying they're right or wrong to believe this, I'm saying this can most likely be the case. 4. It is difficult to find God within ourselves. Absolutely agree with you there. One of the key things in the Bhagvad Gita is Detachment and doing the right thing. I'm well aware that Temples hold a special place because you can actually see Bhagwan there and it's difficult to experience Bhagwan elsewhere but you're hurting people.

It is universally recognised that if life is easy then people are more intelligent, more interested in technological innovation, they invent better things, invent ways to make life easier. That is why all ancient civilizations were formed on the banks of rivers, or in river valleys because if humans have access to the basic necessities which made life easier at that time, they could sit down and think upon philosophical issues, invent new things, which they did, particularly new ways to tell time, and mapping the sky. If people prospered and forged an empire, then they sent their people to map the world. The spirit of discovery, the very basis of modern civilization arises from the fact that people had the luxury of settling down at one place and thriving, thinking about their future generations. On the other hand, the barbarians of the European steppes and Central Asia only knew of a few fundamental things, only followed a few rules in order to survive you kill anything that threatens you, you fuck women in order to gain more children who can help you hunt and you worship a God who will give you strength in battle. Because you believe that God controls the weather, so you pray to God to protect you from harsh winter. That's it.

gl3smvj,"Of course I did. The source was a single web page. No in depth research, no verification of claims. One of the claims in the webpage is that society shifted away from feudalism and towards a working class during that time period, which is what led to the Renaissance. This is a blatantly wrong fact, as feudalism was still rampant during and after the Renaissance. The working class was established during the Industrial Revolution. Of course it changes everything. Every major ancient civilization was established in a river basin. Near a water source. There were no major civilizations in ancient times in Europe, just a horde of Germanic tribes nothing to do with modern Germany going around pillaging and looting everyone. Civilizations in Europe arose due to the establishment of Christianity. The Anglo Saxon tribes came together under the banner of Christianity to form Albion, which later became England. Europeans are not some advanced species. They are a bunch of barbarians who are rich today because they have systematically looted civilizations in Africa, China, Japan and Indian subcontinent. What urban development happened in Renaissance Europe? London, Florence, Venice, Hamburg etc they were all cities long before the Renaissance, long after the Renaissance ended.

I was reading your points and trying to understand your views, but this one sentence alone is enough. Really? The Greek civilisation was part of the Roman Empire? That is like saying Ashoka's Empire was once part of the Mughal Empire. There was almost nothing similar between the Greek and Roman civilizations. The Romans didn't even keep the names of the Greek gods and goddesses. Zeus became Jupiter, Ares became Mars, Hades became Pluto etc. The political system of the Greek city states was based upon democracy. No king or queen, no Lord. The Roman civilization was more or less entirely ruled by emperors. Two different triumvirates, Nero, Caligula, Commodus, Diocletian, Hadrian etc. Most of whom were cruel dictators. What? Are you for real? Greece existed earlier. The Roman Empire came later. Their languages were completely different. Latin wasn't a by product of Greek.

Similar reasoning applies to your point it's why I specifically mentioned controlling their entire bodies in an extremely explicit and dominant manner i.e. total ownership . How many women in India, Hindu and Muslim, and every other religion, eagerly look forward to buying saris? How many of them set aside some savings each year for saris? How many Muslim women would choose to wear a sari if given the option? How many women in the West wear saris when they attend Indian functions? Now, how many Hindu women in India would choose to wear a burqa if given the option? Pray tell. How many women eagerly look forward to their yearly burqa purchase? The reason they are different is because the burqa is an apparent and absolute symbol of dehumanisation. The only part of you visible to the world is your eyes, maybe your face, the rest is monochrome and hidden. It is so far beyond any patriarchal vestige you associate to saris, and that is evident if you try to answer my questions above truthfully. It says it all that people outside Indian culture are far more likely to wear saris gleefully and post pictures everywhere, than wear burqas gleefully and post pictures everywhere. Of course no one should be forced to wear saris. But I'd wager a lot of people would wear them with no forcing necessary. Can't say the same for burqas.",0.7222222222222223,1.0

All the themes problems acknowledged by Vir Das in the video were either half baked or one sided. I do find merit in some subjects but a whole action is an irresponsible act, spelled on the wrong platform. Like 1 Rape ""We"" worship women during the day and rape them at night. Thank God Vir Das didn't add 'We come from an India where we cover women from head to toe and tear their clothes at night' otherwise his core audience would get hurt and things would get communal. And every sane person is aware of this heinous crime and tries his best not to let it happen anywhere in any form. 2 Bollywood We on Twitter claim to be divided over Bollywood and still united by Bollywood in the darkness of the theatre, he said. The darkness of theater to watch the film, which tried to whitewash the image of an actor involved in the 1993 serial bombings. It's the construct that we provide them with it's what they judge us on and just like any stupid act that goes on the generalize the public of a nation that has more to offer than the bad .

hl4geqg,"That is false equivalence. Secondly as mentioned it is not about Truth to begin with. Truth doesn't care about human lives and at scale meaning society, state level it means even less. Western people are not vocal about their domestic situation because they speak the ""Truth"" often it objectively not so, a lot of Right of Center narratives in US are unhinged detached from reality, colonial past only a topic because there are no consequences since they are still in primacy so can ignore the outrage of former colonies. , they are vocal because this dynamic is running on momentum since their polities are strong and as people started to do it, nothing much happened and so they are in this cycle where they think all this is how it is supposed to be because it doesn't have consequences. Truth is not relevant in this. Vir Das is possibly feeling creatively stifled in India and seeing all the other mess as a general citizen as well. He also possibly feels stifled to express this here so is attempting to push the envelope. Fine, we can learn from doing so at times but it has to be a net positive otherwise it's divisive, which is a net negative and also creates its own momentum. It doesn't matter if it's the Truth, what matters is what happens on the ground. Truth is a Construct and it is not higher in the hierarchy than People. People are supreme. Stuff like washing dirtly laundry of home outside is not some generic political speech. EVERY human society that has ever existed has had this bedded into the fibre of their respective socio cultural traditions. Because it is not just an invented construct, it's a byproduct of system interaction which societies and even families learned over our collective history. Although a family is not a country state, this applies to Family as well. Yet, there are times when outside help needs to be leveraged, for the benefit of those in the family themselves, like for example domestic child elderly abuse of some kind. Which is what I said, I am not judging the Vir Das situation that critically yet but in general this approach in principle is counterproductive because India in its current cycle is not where the West is. Actions have Consequences. Other people in other places are not beholden to just leave us alone because of some ancient or modern contract. They will seek to exploit the fault lines and that happens when people, in house, break ranks, for whatever reasons grievances. Not always, I clearly mentioned they are in a cycle a few centuries long and all cycles end, eventually. Again, this is not really a suitable example. Firstly, Japanese work culture has historic socio cultural economic roots. Feudal in nature. There is a good body of research literate on this in fact. Japanese labour practises even as recently as 17 18th century were such that they were working the most among their peers Bengal India, River valley's of China, many European cities and yet their incomes for that work was among the lowest in the world. This never left them even when Japan transitioned into modernity. Because this is cultural baggage for them. And I severely doubt many a Japanese post Meiji pre WW2 went abroad and whined about how bad it is in Japan. By the early 20th century Japan was already among the Developed states and by the late 20th century it A was already a conquered and subjugated nation, it is even today a US Protectorate State, it is NOT a True Sovereign and B it was is already developed hence people are content in their daily lives and hence the spectrum of dialogue they can ignore is expanded. A lot of it is domestic and those doing it abroad are trivially insignificant because of the factors mentioned above. Furthermore, the Topic in question matters as well. This is where the bit about creative selection, etc comes in. Working too long is not the same as your grandpa raping and sodomizing teenage Chinese and Korean girls and then mutilating them and dumping them in rivers. Your Japan example is thus beyond bad. Japan is mind bogglingly touchy about certain things because of the reasons listed before. It considers opening up about this at this cycle of theirs will cause them social cohesion and national project problems and it will, they are absolutely right, they aren't naive. There is no verbatim formula on this. This is human collective affairs. The general public most definitely can be these things as well, it just manifests in a different form, culture traditions expectations is 1 example of it even that Work culture thing of Japan is because of this . It isn't really especially about Reputation as an isolate. A country is not a Company or a person, a country is a pseudo living entity with much longer living time frames, across generations. Things happen slowly to it in general, its reputation sure but also much more, in different forms. Which is THE primary and most important thing. Sort the house and it wouldn't matter what people inside or outside do. What Vir Das does anywhere becomes less relevant then because the house is not in a fragile cycle. That Selective set of things that can be shared gets expanded. It will never be Absolute. TLDR is as I mentioned in a few comments back. Washing dirty laundry in public is a human group level adage. It is grounded in the history of our species for a reason, it is not meh or trivial or that we've outgrown it. We have not. I could go on about how there is Indian elite capture by the Western socio cultural political machine but this is just 1 aspect of the larger set which the TLDR suffices for.",0.08333333333333326,0.0

That will never go until there is reservation, because there will always be the question of ""What is your caste?"".

What this ""hope"" does is give the belief that there is some control over life. That by asking God to intervene, they will be protected, get lucky, and their lot in life will improve. Since human beings are terrible at understanding probability, random events which are good for them reaffirm their belief, and if something goes wrong you can argue its ""all gods plan"" If, you realize that it is just random, that your chances of getting better off in life are non existent, then people fight to fix it. When there is no ""Hope"", then all that is left is to go down in a blaze of glory or to make sure others suffer as much as you.

And why is that? Because we neither support our unis, nor give them autonomy. They have regularly faced budget cuts, even as the government makes them take more and mroe students usually with each reservation reform because the brand value and demand for higher education is high. So they bow down to public pressure and arbitrarily increase seats. Meanwhile everyone wants to get in, and nobody likes being left out, so the application sizes are enormous.

The thing is bjp benefits from communal tension and bjp is causing it and bjp is power so it is a feedback loop in a downward spiral. The main issue for bjp is that they might not want situation to get so bad to attract west's attention which might do a lot of damage to their base.,-1.0,-1.0

i2yi29f,"Firstly, I am not saying it, the great communist magazine the Atlantic is saying it. But I am guessing you didn't even read it before commenting. So here the sections which I felt are relevant. In case you feel I am quoting it out of context or other such things, go ahead read it from the link. ""The prime example of this is the Sri Lankan port of Hambantota. As the story goes, Beijing pushed Sri Lanka into borrowing money from Chinese banks to pay for the project, which had no prospect of commercial success. Onerous terms and feeble revenues eventually pushed Sri Lanka into default, at which point Beijing demanded the port as collateral, forcing the Sri Lankan government to surrender control to a Chinese firm. Our research shows that Chinese banks are willing to restructure the terms of existing loans and have never actually seized an asset from any country, much less the port of Hambantota.A Chinese company's acquisition of a majority stake in the port was a cautionary tale, but it's not the one we've often heard. It was the Canadian International Development Agency not China that financed Canada's leading engineering and construction firm, SNC Lavalin, to carry out a feasibility study for the port. We reviewed a second feasibility report, produced in 2006 by the Danish engineering firm Ramboll, that made similar recommendations to the plans put forward by SNC Lavalin, arguing that an initial phase of the project should allow for the transport of non containerized cargo oil, cars, grain to start bringing in revenue, before expanding the port to be able to handle the traffic and storage of traditional containers. Armed with the Ramboll report, Sri Lanka's government approached the United States and India both countries said no. But a Chinese construction firm, China Harbor Group, had learned about Colombo's hopes, and lobbied hard for the project. China Eximbank agreed to fund it, and China Harbor won the contract. This was in 2007, six years before Xi Jinping introduced the Belt and Road Initiative. Sri Lanka was still in the last, and bloodiest, phase of its long civil war, and the world was on the verge of a financial crisis. There is a bunch of detail in the Atlantic article about how it was financed and Sri Lanka chose the worst deal for itself. For a conflict torn country that struggled to generate tax revenue, the terms of the loan seemed reasonable. Some more details. When Sirisena took office, Sri Lanka owed more to Japan, the World Bank, and the Asian Development Bank than to China. Of the 4.5 billion in debt service Sri Lanka would pay in 2017, only 5 percent was because of Hambantota. The Central Bank governors under both Rajapaksa and Sirisena do not agree on much, but they both told us that Hambantota, and Chinese finance in general, was not the source of the country's financial distress. There was also never a default. Colombo arranged a bailout from the International Monetary Fund, and decided to raise much needed dollars by leasing out the underperforming Hambantota Port to an experienced company just as the Canadians had recommended Sri Lanka chose China Merchants, making it the majority shareholder with a 99 year lease, and used the 1.12 billion cash infusion to bolster its foreign reserves, not to pay off China Eximbank."" The Uganda international airport has been debunked already. Here is another communist article written by Maoist whose nation is extremely friendly to China. Again, I am quoting the part which I feel is relevant, but if you feel I am quoting it out of context , go ahead and read the article. ""Details published in a report in the Daily Monitor newspaper stated that Uganda allegedly had to surrender one of its national asset the Entebbe International Airport to China's EXIM Bank for defaulting on its loan repayments. In the aftermath of this development, Ugandan authorities have been consistently insisting on three issues The grace period is yet to expire and that the Ugandan government is confident of not defaulting on any obligations on repayment that the terms of the loans are semi concessional in nature and in line with Uganda's infrastructure financing programme. most of these claims are truthful.""

The commission reprimanded Patel for having issued a ""coercive"" request to Kannan Gopinathan, the collector for Dadra and Nagar Haveli, and withdraw any notices issued to Gopinathan or any other election officials ""during the election period."" Election Commission Officials state that Praful Patel called election officers to issue them direct instructions. Crucial interference from Patel came after Gopinath sent a notice to Mohanbhai Sanjibhai Delkar for actions that violated the model code. Praful Patel retaliated by issuing a notice to Gopinath which Election Commission Officials described as an act of political vengeance. 7 Since then, Kannan Gopinathan has been replaced with Sandeep Kumar Singh as collector. 2019 Daman Indigenous Land Clearing Protests Valuable seafront land along the 700 metre stretch from Moti Daman Lighthouse to Jampore beach is claimed to be owned by adivasi fishing communities who have lived there for generations as well as by NRI Damanese predominantly living in Leicester, UK. In December 2018, local residents received official looking documents purportedly instructed by Praful Patel ordering the confiscation of their land and demolition of homes to make way for development. 8 In January 2019 Praful Patel hosted a hastily arranged meeting with British MP Keith Vaz but managed to allay his fears about the case. 9 However, by November the bulldozing went ahead and the Daman protests began. On 3 November 2019, Daman Collector Rakesh Minhas issued a Section 144 order banning peaceful assembly of four or more persons, slogan shouting and the use of loudspeakers across the entire district and ordered the conversion of two High Schools into 'temporary jails'. 10 70 protesters were held in these 'temporary jails' and another 8 arrests were made. 11 Few of the adivasi fisherfolk were rehoused whilst most languished traumatised and homeless on the streets near the rubble of their razed homes. 12 As of March 2021 the site is now billionaire Binod Chaudhary of CG Corp Global's The Fern Seaside Luxurious Tent Resort offering tourist accommodation for 80US 57GBP 6000 rupees for night in a tent. 13 2021 suicide of Mohan Delkar Tribal rights advocate and Lok Sabha MP Mohanbhai Sanjibhai Delkar hanged himself at Hotel Sea Green in Mumbai on 22 February 2021 leaving a 15 page suicide note. 14 The note held politicians and administrative officials responsible for ""injustice"", ""insult"" and ""bias"" meted out to him and specifically named Praful Patel. 15 On 5 July 2020, Delkar had posted a video on Twitter threatening to resign as Lok Sabha MP because the local administration was ""hounding him"". Then on 19 September in parliament he raised the issue of ""misbehaviour"" by local officials ""as part of a conspiracy"" claiming that on Liberation Day 2 August , he was ""denied the right to address the people of the region as an MP"". 16 First Information Report FIR under Section 306 abetment of suicide , 389 Putting person in fear of accusation of offence, in order to commit extortion and 506 criminal intimidation and sections of Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe Prevention of Atrocities Act, 1989 was filed against Praful Patel, Daman Collector Sandeep Kumar Singh, former police superintendent Sharad Darade, and few politicians including BJP leader Fatehsinh V Chauhan who has a history of land grabbing disputes. 17 Delkar's son Abhinav has alleged that Patel threatened Delkar to pay 25 crore US 3.5 million or he would be implicated under PASA Act. 18 Save Lakshadweep Campaign 2021 Following the appointment of Praful Patel as the Administrator of Lakshadweep, a campaign against the new administrator's policies gained momentum.

hw34hq7,"That's a disingenuous distinction. All of these things are individual and to some extent community interpretations about religious mandates. Just as Sikhs interpret the Pagdi to be part of the mandate over Kesh. Some Muslims believe that a full naqab is part of the mandate of modesty. Sikhism has an injunction on Kesh but in ways that many sikhs do not follow. Many for instance trim their hair and beard, a form of grooming which is explicitly against what the philosophy on hair grooming was about. The Pagdi too similarly is arguably not necessary. They are simply required to not cut their hair. There's no mandate that it must be covered in a certain way. Heck many Sikh men are often seen with just a topknot if its convenient, leaving their hair bare, or simply covered with a thin cloth. So the analogy is in fact valid. Just because you don't believe its not part of the religion doesn't mean you get to decide for others. Sikhs can choose to cut their hair if they wish. To not cover their uncut hair if they wish. Its also fundamentally a choice. All religion ultimately is a choice. It comes down to which elements of the injunctions you follow and how strictly.

If the shopkeepers collectively refuse to sell for underage kids then the elders will move their ass and get it themselves or find someone who can. Ultimately my idea is to prevent a generation of kids from having gutka. The only way is for the Govt and public to raise awareness. We can't just make a law and sit for people to find out. True. This can happen with anything for that matter. At least the number of kids having access to gutka will come down drastically.
