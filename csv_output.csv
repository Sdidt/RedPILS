The appointment of local officers itself is not a problem, that is just so that the government can enforce the rules more strongly. The first originator thing is definitely a problem, as Whatsapp claims that will break the end to end encryption and I'm not sure what implication it will have on anonymous accounts. 

My main concern with these rules is that they give the government even more power to force social media companies to take down content which they don't like, without there being any well defined policy framework. The 2011 rules themselves were bad and this is making it worse.

We Delhiites are as much citizens of this country if not more contributing ones than the majority, we have the right to enjoy the same benefits as other citizens from their own respective states. 

2. If your argument is valid, then why is the BJP first promising it as part of their election manifesto for decades and then blocking the same promise when it comes into power? What kind of dual faced people are you willing to bring to and keep in power in this country?

2. Why should we resort to creating mental and economic pressure, when the incentive of good earning from a job well done is enough?
3. This useless pressure is the reason for the lack of a good culture of exploration and innovation in our country. If we dream of being a leading economy (on a per capita basis), we must enable our citizens to take risks.
4. This economic cost is a reason why many can't pursue a field of their passion. If we relax this constraint, the economy will have a net benefit in aggregate.

However in every country there's some basis of division that politicians use( like racial division in USA).In India it is cast as well as religion which is somewhat unfortunate cause it surely creates a divided society. 

But most importantly it is the economical development of a country that shapes the society. So India if develops well, then education will spread too and then less chance of Pakistan like fanaticism.

But yeah just like Islam transformed to jihad , I hope no religion take that journey cause that's harmful.

Even if not ban them people themselves should understand not to buy them. Reasons you ask?


1. I hate the smell of smoke, and I don't feel like breathing just like when a smoker passes by me.


2. Many animals like dogs and cows are sensitive to loud sounds. To jo  log kutto or Gau Mata ki raksha ke liye uchalte h unhe bhi ye support nhi krna chahiye. And I too don't like loud noises.


3. Know where those crackers come from. Majority of them are made in China. Un paiso se wo log hmare border pr Ptake phodenge.


4. Grow up. Diwali ptako se bnti. Diwali ko shi aur acche treeke se celebrate krna seekho.


5. Jis paiso ye mehmaan ptake khareedte h un paiso se soan papdi ke alawa ya better kuch dedo, dabbe khaae khatam nhi hote. 😭


6. Now, Some people would add the point of kids. Well they obviously aren't mature enough so even if parents buy them they shouldn't buy a laaaarge amount of them, and also make them understand the real celebration of Diwali.

7. And those who are saying that firecrackers aren't harmful or aren't real reason for pollution, know the chemistry of those crackers and biology of your body. And those are pointing at crop burning, as far as I know crops don't contain any heavy metal.

If you knew anything about NCRB reports, you'd know that the data is provided is by state police. And political violence is a direct result of incompetence and collusion of state police.

Yeah, let's totally ignore that UPs population is around 5 ties of Kerala. Totally.

>According to rough estimates, **over 200 persons belonging to different parties have become victims of killer politics in Kerala since 2000**.

That's why I gave you gross figures love. And yeah i know, the population is 5 times that of kerala. But kerala has one of the least murder rates in all of india and yeah most murders have a political nature. But as the original comment said ""I'm very afraid about kerala"" or some other bullcr@p to which I replied, my implication was to show that by no means are these numbers even close to the alarming rates of murders, political or apolitical in other states. But the rw loves to pin stuff on kerala because cpim. 



>You want to disprove my claim about a general trend by by just talking about 1 out of ~70 years, and you call others dumb and tell them to get perspective? lol



Bhai, I'm sorry for calling people dumb. Just a bit of outrage there. I won't digress on the view that the rw should get more perspective. The IT trolls have fed rwers with a victim complex and anything beyond their purview is evil and deserves more attention than any issue that plaques their collective, which is pretty stupid tbh.

Suuure. After all, the CM himself chairing a meeting to reduce political violence is complete evidence that political violence in Kerala is the lowest.

Don't shift goalpost love. How come whatsapp only provides you with specific data on kerala.

I'm suprised you only remember political murders if it's not committed by your own favourite party



>Suuure. After all, the CM himself chairing a meeting to reduce political violence is complete evidence that political violence in Kerala is the lowest.



Again, the murder rates are one of the lowest in India, and of the ones that happen, most are political in nature. I did acknowledge that in my previous comment love.



>No you didn't



Yeah I didn't provide links for up, because I can't seem to find a reliable source that shows the total number of political murders for 70 years. Single source in google says it's UP with upwards of 4000 murders, but those are not per capita figures.

>  
>No, the present legal process of acquiring Indian citizenship by any foreigner of any category through Naturalization (Section 6 of the Citizenship Act) or through Registration (Section 5 of the Act) stays operational. The CAA does not amend or alter it in any manner whatsoever. Hundreds of Muslims migrating from these three countries have been granted Indian citizenship during the last few years. If found eligible, all such future migrants shall also get Indian citizenship, irrespective of their numbers or religion. In 2014, after the settlement of Indo-Bangladesh boundary issues, 14,864 Bangladeshi citizens were given the Indian Citizenship when their enclaves were incorporated into the territory of India. Thousands of these foreigners were Muslims.

You've asserted:

>Indian Muslims will now require extraordinary proof

What is the extraordinary proof that will be required and how will it be different from the proof that non-Muslim-non migrants will require?

If you are not in the special case covered by the CAA, you'll be subject to rest of The Citizenship Act, 1955, which lays out [four principal ways](https://indiancitizenshiponline.nic.in/acquisition1.htm) through which Indian citizenship can be acquired (Birth, Descent, Registration and Naturalization). Wouldn't a lot of people be eligible at least to acquire citizenship by naturalization? As far as I know, the 1955 act applies to every person irrespective of their religion. Only the CAA lays out a special condition for non-muslim migrants from three countries, that of a reduced time (five years) to be eligible for naturalization.

The purpose of the NRC would be to make sure that everybody tagged as an Indian citizen has the documented proofs that establishes at least one of the four principal requirements under the 1955 act, namely Birth, Descent, Registration and Naturalization.

For example, one of the proofs would be something that can establish that you have been a resident of India for 12 years, so that you're eligible for citizenship by naturalization. My understanding is that it's not that hard to demonstrate that you have been resident in India for twelve years for most people.

It might be hard for the homeless but wouldn't that be a problem for everybody? Including non-muslims who aren't migrants? Because the CAA only applies to non-muslims **who are also** migrants from those three countries and have been a resident of India since at least 31 December 2014.

And even if you don't have documented proof there are other provisions [such as  witnesses or local proofs supported by members of the community, as clarified by the MHA Spokesperson yesterday](https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/no-indian-will-have-to-prove-ancestry-common-documents-will-be-enough-mha-1630201-2019-12-20).

I think that people might be confusing the Assam NRC process for the one that will be implemented nationwide. The Assam NRC guidelines were laid out by the Supreme Court in 2015 specifically for Assam and as of today no official guideline, or process or procedure exists for the nationwide NRC exercise.

So I'm not sure if it's right to be jumping to conclusions if we don't even know what the nationwide NRC exercise will look like.",2019-12-21T07:32:21,/r/india/comments/ebdeup/an_attempt_to_address_the_list_of_simplified/fbhx8gp/,ied1r,65db580f-93a4-4e39-a629-96c5a448305b,1760186379608784898

__________________________________________________________________

**Background**

- India is not a signatory to the Refugee Convention and is not bound to take any refugees whatsoever. There are a number of states that are currently facing increased (illegal) immigration since past few decades.

- This increased illegal immigration over the years mixed with apathy and vote-bank politics by the relevant govts. has turned people hostile toward illegal immigrants in India. There were/are no adequate policies toward settling these migrants or checks in terms of documentation etc. Decreasing job prospects and a fear of increased crimes and marginalization became a grave concern for the local population. Border being highly porous does not help either.

- Comes in: a demand for more stringent attitude toward citizenship/settlement and checking one's legal status in the country. It goes more complicated from here - with a simple fact being that all parties - Congress, BJP, and regional ones - tried to tap into the people's fear and came up with various policies.


**NRC (National Register of Citizens of India)**

- **Overview:** Personal bias, but, I am in favor of it - *theoretically*. I do find that India needs a comprehensive Citizens' Register. Nearly all the EU countries have it. Idea is pretty self-explanatory - keep a comprehensive register of all the citizens and cross-verify their documents. Any new citizen/birth etc. could be provided a National ID etc etc. Sounds good in theory. And document-check might just weed out the illegal immigrants too.

- **Problem?**  I am of the opinion that most policy execution in India is half-baked and creates a lot more problems than it solves. In fact, it might not be an opinion after all - NRC has been attempted in various forms since the 1960's. Government itself found the proposal to have an NRC in Assam impractical. Case in point: introduction of Aadhar. Or demonetization for that matter.

- **Problem II?** This country has ~25% of the population that is unable to read or write adequately. ~70% of our population is rural that tends to have lack of documentation etc. I'd extrapolate anywhere between 50-60% of our country lacks proper documents. Note the list of documents and cut-off date keeps changing. Furthermore, I fail to see any relevant post-WWII evidence in any democratic country in the world where they asked the entire population to prove their citizenship. 

- **Counterpoint:** 1.2B Aadhar cards have been issued till date and 900M people have Voter ID card. That leaves approx. <30M people who may potentially not have no Aadhar or Voter ID for that matter. A well-managed/multi-step document check might mitigate the fear of people due to the lack of documents.

- **Counterpart II:** NRC is critical for the North-East that have bore the grunt of illegal immigration since the 60s/70s at least - from the post-Bangladesh refugee wave (predominantly Hindus), to Chakmas and Hajongs (Buddhists), to the recent Rohingyas (Muslims). The fact that the North East lacks the economic growth and resources only adds to the fuel. At least *some* step is critically required to solve the issue of illegal immigrants to the country. 


**CAA (Citizenship Amendment Act):**

- **The Rohingyas:** Lets start with the North-East and the influx of the Rohingyas. 40k+ Rohingyas sought refuge in India after the Burmese government expelled them. Burmese do not consider Rohingyas as their citizens as they consider them as immigrants brought in from Bangladesh during the British Raj. Bangladesh, unsurprisingly, is of the position that they are the natives of Myanmar and should be protected by that government. Do note that Bangladesh is now home to 1.1M Rohingya refugees. More importantly, both parties have used refugees for vote-banks: in 2015, 40,000 Chakmas/Hajongs were naturalized as Indian citizens despite the protests by Arunachal Pradesh. 


- **Act - what is it about?** Members of the Hindu, Christian, Sikh, Buddhist and Zoroastrian communities who have come from Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Bangladesh till December 31, 2014 and facing religious persecution there (no documentary evidence required) will not be treated as illegal immigrants but given Indian citizenship. It also relaxes the provisions for ""Citizenship by naturalization"". 
The law reduces duration of residency from existing 11 years to just 5 years for people belonging to the same six religions and three countries. **One could argue** - what is the issue with reducing the residency requirement for minority sects from aforementioned countries? Several democratic countries around the world have precedence where they permit a reduced time for naturalization for certain sects/ethnicities due to atrocities committed (eg. Germany for ethnic Jews during the Third Reich, Spain for Sephardic Jews expelled in the 17th century!)

- **Current scenario:** CAA aims to put a hard stop on illegal immigration/asylum by the Muslims. Whether there is merit to it or not is a difficult topic between balancing humanitarianism which remains one of the core foundations of our country and ensuring national security. Proponents of the latter claim that it is easier for, say, an Islamic fundamentalist to pose as an ordinary Muslim - the fact that India does not have adequate infrastructure and apparatus in place to ensure a thorough intelligence adds to the pressure. 

- **Counterpoint to above:** I fail to see how approving citizenship to all the illegal immigrants actually serves any purpose. Illegal immigration to the North-East could continue to remain an issue and create pressure on local population. If possible, settle them across India (but of course, this is not much talked about)

------------------------------------------------------


- **Why we should protest?** On one hand, it doesn't sound so bad, particularly for the urban-dwellers: Governments asks you to prove your citizenship, show them documents. And guess what? With CAA, we are also mitigating the issue of illegal immigration as well to quite an extent. (unless you are a Muslim) And if you are unable to show documents, well - tough luck - you'll be scrutinized. One could argue that anyhow, we are supposed to prove our legal status in the country during the passport application etc. 

And that is where the problem lies. The scrutiny, administrative execution, and removal of a certain religion. A significant number of people may fail to pass this documentation scrutiny: especially if they are from the lower socio-economic status which, coincidentally, has a higher proportion of Muslims. Add to the fact that if declared illegal immigrant owing to the fact that they could not yield relevant documents, that person from Muslim population risks detention or deportation (to where?) in the country s/he was born and raised in.


- **Counterpoint:** Nonetheless, I would still like to ask - what should be done to resolve the current and prevent and manage further illegal immigration to India?",2019-12-22T01:54:00,/r/india/comments/ebdeup/an_attempt_to_address_the_list_of_simplified/fbkiddm/,2o0exdu0,4578ca87-dceb-4781-a449-5425f7197455,1760186379610882048

So the law was instituted to supposedly protect minorities from these 3 countries, right ?

If that is the case, then is there a sizeable population of Muslim minorities in these predominantly Muslim countries? 

So if someone was born in India between 1954 and present, shouldn’t their birth certificate or other such documentation be enough to prove citizenship? How does all that work?

Supposing someone’s parents or grandparents have been Indian citizens from 1947 onwards but they don’t have their documents with them. Will their children or grandchildren - having been born in India to Indian parents, who presumably have some form of documentation- not be able to confirm their citizenship?

Also just an FYI, I have just been alerted to this situation. I am simply trying to educate myself on the issue and am trying to understand the facts. I am not looking for accusations or criticism.

> The CAB automatically gives citizenship to non-Muslims even if they are illegals.

Only if they are illegals from Pakistan/Afghanistan/Bangladesh. And they have to prove they were citizens of those 3 countries. If they cannot because they don't have documents, or if they illegally migrated here from, say Malaysia, they are still illegal immigrants, and CAB does not grant them automatic citizenship.


> So there is no way for a Muslim refugee from those 3 countries to come to India. They can never get Indian citizenship. 

""Hundreds of Muslims migrating from these three countries have
been granted Indian citizenship during the last few years"" - MHA.

> Sri Lanka..Tamils, Burma..Muslims, China..Tibetans and Muslims.. So no, those three countries are not special.

Your entire argument is based on a hypothetical scenario that has no basis in the current form of any legal binding paper. You time and again cite the comments of Amit Shah as a resource for supporting your hypothesis. He never in his comments said that Indian Muslims (who are citizens) have to declare their citizenship during NRC. So how does one extrapolate Shah's statement or CAA's policies about immigrant Muslims as a threat to citizens of India? I don't understand how everyone just came to that conclusion? Is it mentioned anywhere explicitly that Indian Citizens have to declare their citizenship as part of NRC? Assam was a special case where NRC was implemented mainly for its proximity with the neighbouring countries. Can the outcomes of the exercise be extrapolated to the entire country?

Also, the primer that you have added in the sticky, starts with our preamble. Our preamble is about citizens of India. Who's residential status can be converted into a citizenship of India is matter of policy rather than anything else. So, I am still not clear how you can call CAA a violation of constitution. And just because NLSIU students or any media expert say that it has a potential in the future to be dangerous to Indian Muslims doesn't mean it should be accepted as a gospel. CAA is a 3 page document. Just read it yourself. Read facts and try to infer conclusions yourself.

It seems all the paranoia is based on a ""what if"" and ""it's possible in the future"". That's not a logical way to argue bills and legal matters.

**Provided that any person belonging to Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi or Christian community from Afghanistan, Bangladesh or Pakistan, who entered into India on or before the 31st day of December, 2014 and who has been exempted by the Central Government by or under clause (c) of sub-section (2) of section 3 of the Passport (Entry into India) Act, 1920 or from the application of the provisions of the Foreigners Act, 1946 or any rule or order made thereunder, shall not be treated as illegal migrant for the purposes of this Act.**

Sub-section (2) of section (3) of passport entry into India act just gives power to center government to make any exemptions in any condition of this (Passports) act.

This is done to keep up CAA to be in-sync with passports act future amendments (if any).

There is nothing for a citizen to fulfill in this, this reference is just for government.

Also, I would like to add, **the latest amendment to Passport entry into India act, on 8 Sept 2015, changed passport act to allow non-muslim refugees on the basis of religious fear from these countries to stay in India even if they had/hadn't entered the country with valid papers prior to 31.12.2014.**




And lets come to the next part with **OR** 

They are saying, along with being these minorities from these specific countries, person should fulfill criteria of foreigners act, 1946 (latest amendment), which clearly states 
in paragraph 3A, that 

**Exemption of certain class of foreigners.- (I) Persons belonging to minority communities in Bangladesh and Pakistan, namely, Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains, Parsis and Christians who were compelled to seek shelter in India due to religious persecution or fear of religious persecution and entered into India on or before the 31 st December, 2014 with or without valid passport/travel documents are hereby granted exemption from the application of provisions of the Foreigners Act, 1946 and the orders made thereunder in respect of their stay in India without such documents or after the expiry of those documents, as the case may be, from the date of publication of this order in the Official Gazette.**


Hope I am clear, also I am attaching screenshot of the amendments of both acts which added **religious persecution/fear of religious persecution**.

The very fact that you have to prove ancestry is kind of unnecessary at this juncture. Also, the other important thing one has to focus on is that the words ""religious persecution"" doesn't feature in the amendment. Rather the proviso says - x,y,z communities as exempted by the govt.  in rules or orders made under foreigners act and passport act. So your apprehension is misplaced. Not entirely false.  
The reason being that the criteria of religious persecution appears merely on the order of MHA in 2015 exempting those minorities to get extended visas. Under the said acts. 
That order can be changed at any time. Without the parliament's assent. Meaning that the criteria can also be changed. Say economic persecution. Or likewise.  
So when the criteria changes, the people who will be getting citizenship will entirely be in the hands of the executive. Which is pretty scary because non Muslims have the blanket protection under CAA which says they are exempted by orders under the said acts (foreigners and passport acts) but it doesn't mention criteria of religious persecution in the CAA itself.  
This is what people should be educated about. My concern is most people I talked to on either sides donno much. And even though it is necessary for everyone to deliberate upon such a sensitive and pressing issue, it is sad that people don't do their research before that. This only reduces this debate to merely being a war between ideologies and political parties but not about how this CAA+NRC is utterly insufficient and unnecessary.

See as per some records there are around 30k who have sought refuge on grounds of religious persecution. So it would imply only this small
number of people would benefit from the act. 

But Amit Shah has himself claimed that there are lakhs of crores of such people. According to his logic there are many others who haven’t came forward in the past fearing prosecution. 

The reason religious persecution is not explicitly mentioned in the act suggests that the govt. wants to give all illegal migrants who are hindu, sikh etc. citizenship irrespective of whether they were persecuted or not.

Edit 2 : I see you are mentioning the current process that is there when someone asks for citizenship based on persecution. What I am talking about is how this act will now make that whole process much easier for non-muslim communities, where just being a hindu/sikh/etc. from the 3 countries, can be seeen as someone who faced persecution without going through the complex process of proving that.",2019-12-19T01:58:44,/r/india/comments/ebdeup/an_attempt_to_address_the_list_of_simplified/fbb2i25/,110c65,6a80ad94-04a3-4ed5-ba68-49c6c58d9587,1760186379642339330

1. INC can claim that they gave moral support to AAP so that the votes don't get divided. But that's just because it was extremely weak to start with. And even if it did do it with nothing but pure love for country in heart, it's a sad state of affairs when the main opposition party of the country which is supposed to tackle the Bhagwa brigade is reduced to this level in the capital itself.

2. Vote share of BJP in 2015 Assembly elections - 32.2. that too in the peak of Modi wave. 
Approx vote share of BJP in 2020 assembly elections - 38.43.
The vote share (and seats) actually increased. 
The Shaheen bagh vs us campaign DID work.

3. Leaders like Manish Sisodiya won by 3k votes. He was trailing since the morning. And he is second in command as well as the one who is given credit for educational reforms. This could have been a disaster. A loud phew.

4. AAP did a good amount of work but it can not be denied that freebies played an important role. Spending 1720 crores on subsidies out of 1790 crore energy budget is one of the things. How will it play out in future when there can not be any more freebies?

This is exactly me as well. Except that I am a practicing Sikh and not atheist. 

Personally, I hate both parties a lot. To me, it seems like people on this sub are thinking that getting Rahul Gandhi as PM is going to solve most problems (as long as he replaces Modi). The answer is NO. It will only solve half the problems but the Congress will bring new problems for the country. Rahul Gandhi is not some saviour. People only think that the country has become worse in only last 6 years despite the fact that the country has seen many ups and downs throughout the years. Situation was also bad in 1947-48, 1975-77, 1984-89, 1997-99, 2011- present.

I'll be honest, BJP is doing things that Congress has already done in the past.

Genocides- ✅
Divisive Politics - ✅
Corruption - ✅
Oppression on Minorities - ✅
Curbs on Opposition - ✅
Lack of Transparency - ✅
Misusing Judiciary - ✅
Provocative Statements - ✅
Kashmir - ✅

The only thing that BJP still hasn't done are :-

Fascism - ❌ (Emergency)

Editing the Preamble - ❌ (Indira edited the Preamble during the Emergency Period)

Nepotism - ❌

I can only see BJP becoming another version of Congress. It's ministers are arrogant, Prime Minister is completely out of touch with the realities on the ground. 

Unfortunately, people on this sub are completely out of touch with the reality. This happened in 2019 as well where many were actually predicting a BJP loss. Either they will support the farmers (who are protesting against BJP) and at the same time, call them ignorant and dumb just because many of them vote for BJP. Nobody has talked to people in the villages and ask them why they vote for their party. I've seen people on this sub calling all BJP supporters as stupid, anti-Muslim and bigots despite the fact that BJP voters are equal to almost 40% of India's adult population. 

You can't just call that many people stupid just because you don't like them voting for a particular party. A lot of them are centrists as well. You need to understand their reasons for voting for BJP and tell them why they are wrong. You can't just call them stupid first and expect that people are going to vote for the left.

Both Right-Wing and Left-Wing thrive on hate and negativity. BJP is absolutely horrible but so is Congress. I hope, people on this sub realise that quickly.",2020-10-07T19:13:41,/r/india/comments/j6i5yf/ani_do_you_know_why_china_was_able_to_take_away_a/g7zpk3p/,-1,de87f847-c702-45d3-a17c-8fefda0dc67d,1760185648673718273

Since Hinduism is a way of life, I consider culture, lifestyle, rituals, and dharma as Hinduism. Not just the dharma. That is because unlike Abrahamic religions we do not have an absolute text but guidelines. So, all these factors constitute the religion.

And that is also the basis for my comment.

Regardless of what original intention may have been, the practices had, at some point, intertwined with Hinduism. These faults existed long before Mughals and British came in. It was exploitable and exploited before others exploited it.

With time, we slowly separated right from wrong and will continue to do so, but not all of these problems were ""planted"" by outsiders. Given that our society had been practicing them for centuries before anyone came in, we share responsibility.

""..*but atleast Hinduism or rather the practitioners knew what was right and what was wrong to just stop practicing*""

Yes, this is also what I was saying in my previous comment when I said Hinduism *has progressed with time and with time, we will overcome what shortcomings we have.*

But people didn't just stop practicing, they applied the dharma with their times and slowly removed the bad components.

We need to do the same but a common problem I see is people assuming Hinduism to perfect and needing no change. Some just blame each and every single problem in Hinduism to the Mughals and the British. People need to accept that there were faults that we, as a society, had ourselves before anyone exacerbated it.

So then again, using your own logic. 

You can identify yourself with any sexuality you want, but legally a marriage as of right now in Indian Penal Code is only between a male and female.

I think you are confusing my argument as being my personal desires. I am merely telling you legally what currently the situation exists, as is. And allowing same-sex marriage is not as simple as SC striking down a provision..

Ideally she should have been careful with her words, then again but she said it in the heat of the moment when much crasser words against Hindus were getting said in the media. Third, politics and religion are too intervened and the other side gets massive advantage over this. So why should only Hindu politicians respect the other religions, but not expect the same from them?

I can all be for stopping plastic straws if you address the fishing net issue (but they won't). Forcing/ Mandating a specific section of people to stop using plastic straws would be even more stupid and biased.

If these politicians who are banning the fireworks for Diwali (aka plastic straws) addressed all the other issues (the fishing net), then the fireworks will not even be a problem.

It is exactly the case here. These persons were born to nazis who r\_p3d german jews. And, today, german public is supposed to grant them special privileges because decades ago one of their ancestors had gassed & murdered a few hundred jews.

I don't see this thing as an indian; I see it as a tribal person. May be some people could consider giving up their india-centric tunnel vision and simply look at the raw facts of this situation.

me: if someone identifies as nazi, they must not live in germany or any nation which supports the right of jewish people to breathe / be alive.

you: they are mixed and not nazi - they would never have lived with jews if they were nazi.

me: well, nazi have routinely spoken about racial purity so they will have kicked these mixed persons out & hence they did not go with nazi and remained with the jewish people.

you: they are mixed and not nazi.

You see what's happening here? Just replace nazi with the other invader (with whom certain persons identify by prefixing the race of the invader ahead of ""indian"") and replace jews with tribals/natives of Bharath.

You said that X will have gone to britian if they were british and not stay back in india. I showed that the brits of that time (1947) were openly racist & put up boards saying ""\_\_\_\_\_\_ and dogs not allowed"". Thus, these mixed persons such as X will have faced abuse if they even tried to go to britian. And, you are back saying X are not gora, they are not british.

If there is no differentiating factors then there is absolutely no reason to add the prefix on the word ""indian"", is there? The fact that these persons choose to voluntarily identify themselves with said prefix means they claim ancestral roots with the abuser, with the invader.

Again, going back to nazi scenario. Even if a person knows that 2 - 3 generations ago some of their ancestors worked for the nazi ss & some were jewish, today that mixed-race person will not proudly add 'nazi-' as a prefix to 'german'.

They didn't voluntarily choose to identify as such. They were English speakers with Christian culture. There was no need for identification at that time.

They don't call themselves Anglo Indians.  I don't think they ever called themselves as such. Today's Anglo Indians aren't identifiable on any parameters because they are completely mixed in with the local culture hence no need for reservation hence no protest against the removal of reservation. 

And you are comparing Nazi with Anglo. One is an ideology/political party and one is nationality/race. There's no comparison. If you have British ancestry there's no way to deny that.

what the nazis did specifically to german jews lead to the extermination of millions of jews.

what the gora (not just brit, but also other caucasians) did to multiple tribes globally lead to the extermination of millions of natives worldwide.

2.

why nazis acted like that - they felt they were ""superior"" and needed to ""purify"" the rot.

why brits acted like that - they felt they were ""superior"" and had to civilize the heathens. 

Yeah - totally different. No comparison.

​

>doesn't mean you automatically are a nazi.

Unless you received special legislative representation in the german parliament for 7 decades since the death of nazi organizational structures.

Let me assure you - the natives of Bharath did not fight for and provide special legislative representations to pharsees (who are also non-native, but not abusive / invasive species). It was the progeny of the nazi that fought for the legislative representation.

​

>hence no protest against the removal 

Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence. The fact that there are no jains shouting ""jai jinendra"" and destroying buildings is not evidence that destructive ideas are not present in jain philosophy. To ascertain absence of violence in jain ideas, one must verify the texts and understand them contextually. Most jains being peaceful is indicative of an inherent bias towards non-violence in the jaina thinking - but that in and of itself can't be conclusive. Similarly, the lack of protests is indicative of your premise (ie, they have mixed-up with the general population and have shunned the identity of their abusive ancestors); however, it is certainly not conclusive.

113k1jh,When Indira Gandhi cracked down on BBC,3d4x4,t5_3d4x4,j8rbjkr,"How can someone actually in their right frame of mind equate Indira regime's emergency to a mere banning of a propaganda laden documentary.

During Indira's emergency along with taking away press freedom there was a crackdown on trade unions as well. The Indira government reportedly banned trade union activity, strikes by workers and imposed fixed wages with no scope for bonuses. The workers that protested against this faced strict repression. Another controversial aspect of this period was Sanjay Gandhi’s mass sterilization program across the country and demolitions of slums for ‘beautification’ of cities with little to no prior notice to slum dwellers.

The most jarring aspect of Indira's emergency was Constitutional rights of people of India were suspended. Right to approach court for enforcement of Fundamental rights was taken away. Several of Gandhi’s political opponents were imprisoned including LK Advani, Atal Bihar Vajpayee, Morarji Desai and JP Narayan. A mass sterilisation programme was also enacted by Sanjay Gandhi. All powers were vested in the hands of the Union government. This all went on for 21 months. 

 When BJP and Modi remind people of dark days of emergency, it's the culmination of all these draconian acts which took place when emergency was declared. 

Modi ever since 2014 has never suspended your right to approach the Supreme Court or a High Court for enforcement of your fundamental rights. There has been no curtailment of press freedom. Malicious channels like NDTV, Quint, The Wire have regularly peddled propaganda and post Adani takeover sepoys like Rubbish who are on payroll of Congress have flocked to Youtube. 

IT dept has statutory right to conduct raids. They don't have to wait for the cover of emergency to conduct raids on suspicious bodies. These BBC are habitual offenders in tax evasion. Acc to a 2012 report, thousands of public employees, including those at the BBC, were not paying their taxes at the source. Report was by  public accounts committee in the United Kingdom (UK).  In 2016, HM Revenue and Customs had reportedly begun an investigation into more than 100 BBC broadcasters amid allegations that they had underpaid their income tax and National Insurance contributions.

But this argument here is really a weak argument for hypocrisy. Few decades ago Indians used to get married when they were 12-13yo, if their kids/grandchildren aren't allowed by them to marry at 12-13yo, would you say they're being hypocritical? This as well as containing dissent by the previous government was and is totally wrong. Did we elect the current government to continue the wrongdoings of the previous ruling party or was it for the opposite reason?

Like it or not, containing dissent might seem like a victory to you when you support a political party (beyond reasons), but do remember when there is something which you find troublesome at your personal level (you or your family, friends) and when you decide to stand up against them, be sure that containing your dissent wouldn't be that hard. No one would even know because things like that would be normalised.

For a democracy, it's the best thing for people to criticize and question the ruling party. It keeps the political party on their toes. If they're not on their toes and start thinking votes will anyway flow to them regardless, they'll take things for granted and would really not care about personal freedom for regular folks like us.",2023-02-16T16:59:07,/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/113k1jh/when_indira_gandhi_cracked_down_on_bbc/j8qycga/,1ghrpcu,326220af-6000-415c-9480-aa5f1d8cfaf6,1760183277731184640

Still all I could articulate is, This doesn't bother Indian Muslims and they shouldn't be concerned and hence shouldn't protest = protests are ridiculous. To this there is a simple counter, It violates the constitution which clearly states that the state will not discriminate against any religion, caste, sect (that's the gist of it). And the bill (act now) conveniently jumps around this fundamental doctrine and also goes one step further by not including other states where Islam is not the prevalent religion (Sri Lanka, Myanmar, China/Tibet and others), the irony being those are the states where minority persecution is much more well documented and is further facilitated by the state. Not undermining the persecution in Islamic nations, but that's what the facts tell us.

One more thing, I guess it's commonsense that a community would rise up when they see any regulation which discriminates against them (however minute it is, which isn't the case here btw). So, their standing up is rational and can't be shrugged off as ill-informed mob-hysteria. This argument alone is enough to back the protests if we're going by the commonsense still. And let's be honest here, we all know how resistance movements are in our country and would advise everyone to get off their high horse and contemplate everything with a level head, keeping context in mind (not undermining the condemn-able stuff done by rioters).

As proposed by your Fuhrer Modi. Not pass CAA and retain the population back or put them in detention centers and harass them. 

Please don't get your information about Assam or northeast from those oversimplified 6 slide Instagram posts. Talk to someone who is actually from the northeast. Your mainland humanitarian idealism don't exactly have much gravitas when indegenous people are being massacred by Bangladeshi in their homes and villages right now as we speak. These massacres are happening because the indegenous people were out protesting against CAA which just made a huge chunk of the Illegal immigrants legal. Sitting behind your screen in a land away from these atrocities, disconnects you from the ground realities. So I can understand your idealism.

If you know something more let me know
Caste system was not prominent in kashmiri hindus because of various religious invasions of buddhism, jainism and islam continously over the years.

Most people had converted in the 1700s afghan raids 

But whats a sad tale that the muslim people living there follow a caste system among themselves and discrimation is still a problem today.

You're kinda right, but tangential to my point. 

Jews were discriminated against too throughout history, even in Germany. All the way since Christ's death. Thats one reason why people (even jews) didnt think too much of Nazi party in the initial years.

Hindu and muslims have had friction all the time as well, but thats no defense for whats going on. That also does not mean that we should not be alarmed by the extreme division there is now.

But once you accept it, it is easier to understand the world we live it. I would call myself a libral but I don't know what that exactly means. I agree that what happened in Kashmir was done by people who call themselves Muslims, even though many would say that they are not true muslims. After all, if you kill even one soul it is as if you have killed the entire reality or something along those lines. I agree that it was painful to see what happened in Kashmir. I could see how people were flinching while seeing the violence. And they have brought their kids with them. Ironically, they were okay with having the kids watch the violence but one scene of nudity and they scream about taking kids outside. 

I don't agree with what BJP is doing to the nation though. What this movie indicates. The consent they are trying to manufacture. There is a greater nuance to what this story shows. And what matters is what gets done now. We all agree that what happened to Kashmiri Pandits was wrong. The movie insinuated that such violations have been occuring to them for centuries. So now what?

But then I guess we all discussing about the need for change and hope to do something about it. A small task can go a long way. I am not an active Redditor who comments on posts or stuff. But today I chose to change that because I felt the need to do so. If my comment can touch even 5 people who decide that enough is enough and we need change, I will continue to comment and post where I find it necessary.

But it has to start now. We have less than 3 years to the General elections. It’s important that we make the right noise now rather than wait for 2024 for this political party to play a new trick along the lines of patriotism or religion to come to power.

I am not a congress supporter. Most of us aren’t, but the other day I saw a video post about RaGa talking about the covid wave in 2020 as a tsunami and how elected officials were ridiculing him. And in that video you had the comment from Delhi HC which noted that the second wave is a tsunami in 2021. I am not giving RaGa credit where he doesn’t deserve, but I would laud that post for recognising his comment and highlighting it.

Similarly, I would laud each one of us who are taking the time out to criticise and hold the current regime accountable for the current crises. Most of us didn’t speak up against the govt earlier. We turned a blind eye when students were harassed during the JNU issue and anti CAA protests. But now this was the breaking point. What’s important is that we maintain the flow and ask the right questions.

I am hopeful that we can bring about change. Even if BJP win in 2024. It’s important that we have strong opposition numbers in both houses. I guess we can’t control RS directly, but LS we can.

""Multiple people were texting the same set of sentences, and it was people from outside India making these tweets"". 

Two questions:

0. Let us indeed assume that your premise is true - I mean in a country of a billion people with almost entity of the country going through the SAME crisis (lack of oxygen, medicines, supplies and irresponsible political parties conducting rallies in the middle of the pandemic), I think it's plausible that multiple people might end up tweeting the same thing. There are hundreds of millions of active Twitter users from India. Anyways, let's assume you are correct in assuming the text was indeed copy pasted by multiple different people.

1. Have you ever been part of a fucking social media campaign or protest? When students in my university protested against the administration for their tone deaf stance to student mental health, and increasing tuition fees last year, we setup a tweet campaign as well. One of the FIRST things we did there was to maintain a shared Google Doc with a set of potential tweets that people could copy and share, along with a consistent set of hashtags to use. One person tweeting alone does nothing - the whole point of a social media campaign is coordinated fucking action. 

2. This now leads us to two important questions: (1) was the content of these tweets objectively false? No. (2) were they inviting violence? No. So if multiple Indians share the SAME tweet which is not fake news and which is not inviting violence WHAT DID THEY WRONG?

Modi exists on another tier of support. BJP's own workers and supporters, sympathizers might criticize the Party or even non-BJP people might do it but personal position on Modi can be different. There is no need for mutual exclusive dynamic in this. These positions can coexist side by side.

I agree to this point. But it still depends on the nature of education provided.

>Uneducated people are gullible because they are easier to manipulate by educated people.

But that's my exact point. Why should people who can vote wrongly vote?

>unwise to suggest those who haven't yet had the privilege are to be shown any form of social separation. 

I wrote in another reply that this should go hand in hand with education. But my central idea is based on the fact that the eligibility exam shall not be based on education as such. Even educated people fall for the most ridiculous of scams. (BYJUs, etc)

A better way to explain my point would be the meaning of educated. Education doesn't depend on a degree. It depends on ability to think critically and make the right choice, having a structured moral compass, and not being blind to certain ill-acts in name of self-denial. In this manner, people with basic education, can chance this criterion.


While this idea does sound far-fetched, I would like to conclude with an example:-
An uneducated village is promised electricity and that too for free for a long period of time. While this canvassing is obviously fraudulent, uneducated people, who have not seen these schemes before, shall simply accept how great the situation shall turn for them.

Whereas a truly educated person can differentiate between right and wrong and make a better choice.

The only problem would be to develop an examination based on such criteria.

All things considered, I don't necessarily think this is a bad thing, especially given the various circumstances around the world today (or for the past 15 something years for a smaller number of us).

Throughout my mid teenage years, I went through a pretty rough phase due to my family's financial issues and having just moved to a totally unfamiliar country (this was around the start of the post-9/11 USA, so think about how ""welcomed"" we were at the time)... I couldn't imagine how I would have managed to cope through the challenges if my siblings and I didn't have video games to accompany us. It was our only consolation at home, after a day of struggling to keep up with classes, communicating in fluent English, and getting teased/bullied by local kids in school.

Of course, had the situation been better, then people wouldn't have to find enjoyment in video games; we would actually lead a happy and balanced lifestyle, with a fulfilling career, relationships, and such. But as we all know, given how fucked up many of our political systems are, this is more often an ideal than a reality.",2020-07-28T19:49:18,/r/india/comments/hz9umz/modi_govt_wanted_to_ban_pubg_but_realised_youth/fzi59nj/,rap43he,af81c664-0d99-4ba2-a44e-2e1674ddeb87,1760185062530220038

22. Misinformation.

23. Staging resistance. Where the other parties will always compromise with government showing that government is working for the people.

We said, sure uncle. We support Hindi as a national language and we believe that all Indian languages should be taught in schools, not just Hindi. We should be as Indian as we can be by knowing all Indian languages.

But the reality is, when we have to go for a job, even the government asks for English. Then Hindi has no value and you regret not learning and remaining poor for the rest of your life.

I've seen many people say that this idea was already in our mythology, which to be fair isn't different from other mythologies; but often these things turn out to be true, because the possibilities in mythology exceed in what we are currently capable of thinking.

So anyone(specially ones from previous generation) who say ""Yeh to hamare shastro me likha tha""; isn't technically wrong. THE GREEKS DO HAVE A 2 HEADED DOG THO.

People have this image that genz/millennials are kinda edgy. To counter this stereotype, agree with other's opinions first, and show them how learnt you're in their own field. For example, in the above case, you could've told her that we were good and formulated a lot of mathematics and Ayurveda was one of the best of that time.

Now once you've got her to agree with you, now it's your time to convince her that she's wrong. You've just destroyed that edgy teen stereotype by pleasing her with facts.To do further damage reduction, talk about hinduism and show her you're more well versed with Hinduism than her. This is not only to woo her, but the public too, so that either they don't interfere or bash you. Don't bring out that you're atheist or anything.

Now to prove them wrong, you could've said that now the times have changed. Remember, you could've said that right at the beginning but that wouldn't have worked. It'll now because she's more vulnerable. You don't have to make other person feel guilty or inferior or anything, you just have to make them realize that they're wrong.

On another note, it is things like these that made the common man vote for a strongman and a party which seems to have a modicum of sense that a nobody can rise to power within the party instead of only Gandhis. CG's BJP leaders are all rank and file workers of BJP or their mother org, the RSS. Even lok sabha MP is a person who was a common foot worker in the BJP, whereas Congress has land owners and literal rajas, people with 2 generations in politics, people owning 100- even 500-700 acres or Land, in a state which had 49.8% people under the official Poverty line in 2010s, a tribal state where SC, ST, and OBC make up 65% of the population.

It a.fact that corruption and nepotism is synonymous with congress-I. 

This government in Chhattisgarh is in power merely since 2018, things which were working are now faltering, from as simple as littering and garbage collection to as serious as this event.

Public/government servants simple unwilling to do their jobs, if you go to a office, people are simply sitting gossiping, it wasn't this bad under the BJP, albeit they were crooks too, but BJP built the state to where it is now, growth rates were one of topin the country and people got access to better infrastructure and also jobs.

* Kamal shukla is a good journo , the idealistic kind - fiercely anti-establishment - was against BJP too earlier.
* I personally know the the MLA  he was a senior IAS officer , had made decent good money in past , he is not seen as a good or even efficient officer . The thing is post his depature from service he was out of money making stint for long and this case - kamal shukla wrote articles about sand smuggling and involvement of MLA's man , quite normal NREGA activity of every MLA. I frankly would like my MLAs to earn money from this rather than via becoming criminal mafia . He maybe corrupt but not any goon - very pleasant to talk , just not his philosophy . Also such incidents are a blot to his image and future ministerial positions , small state , such things matter :)
* In my state , no one can kill a journo like that , things got escalated to physical because of kamal shukla's articles , MLA's man were pissed off bcoz of those articles , ground workers don't have much brain.
* Congress has responded decently well , it created a huge ruckus in media . Small peaceful state such things matter a lot here . The message has been sent to not even touch/rough up journos.

No, he shouldn't get involved because a lot of the facts are still murky and the CM himself has taken cognizance of this matter:

1) **Chattisgarh CM has issued a statement**:

> Chhattisgarh Chief Minister Baghel condemned the incident, but claimed journalists were safer now than under the previous regime. This incident is condemnable.  It should not have happened. If it has happened we will take strict action,” [Baghel said in a press conference](https://www.huffingtonpost.in/entry/congress-chhattisgarh-journalists-attacked_in_5f71cd3ec5b61af20e78bccd).

2) **Police complaint and FIR has laready been registered**:

> Confirming the assault incident, the superintendent of police, M.R. Ahire, told [The Wire](https://thewire.in/media/chhattisgarh-journalist-kamal-shukla-attacked-by-local-congress-leaders-fir-registered) that an FIR has been registered in the matter under sections 294 (public acts of obscenity), 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), 506 (criminal intimidation) and 34 (act done by several persons in furtherance of common intention) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). As per the local police, Jitendra Singh Thakur, Ghaffar Memom, Ganesh Tiwari, Maqbool Khan and others have been named in the FIR ... the police have described the assault as a clash between two groups due to some ‘aapsi ranjish’ (personal rivalry).

3) **A police Inspector has been suspended, and a [Special Investigation Team formed](https://indianexpress.com/article/india/chhattisgarh-journalists-assault-sit-formed-after-panel-points-to-inaction-by-police-congress-6720180/)** to investigate the matter further - this was done **on the basis of a report submitted by a panel of journalist formed by the Congress government**:

>  The decision came after a six-member journalists’ panel set up by the Chhattisgarh government submitted its report on Saturday. Kanker **police station in-charge Mordhwaj Deshmukh was suspended by Bastar IG P Sundarraj on the directions of Chief Minister Bhupesh Baghel**. “Following the factual report of the journalists’ panel, an SIT has been set up by Bastar IG to investigate the incident. The CM has instructed the IG for immediate action,” read a statement issued by the state government.

4) **After the protests, even the [Governor has received a delegate](https://indianexpress.com/article/india/kanker-journalist-calls-off-hunger-strike-6721401/) of the journalist**:

> His letter was submitted to the Governor by a 10-member delegation, including several journalists. “The Governor has assured the delegation that the case will be duly investigated and the culprits will be punished,” a statement from the Governor’s office read. 

5) **Both political rivalry and media rivalry are involved in this**: The senior journalist attacked is also a leftist social activist, while one of the Congress associated attackers is an associate editor in [another magazine](https://www.huffingtonpost.in/entry/congress-chhattisgarh-journalists-attacked_in_5f71cd3ec5b61af20e78bccd):

> Shukla is a senior journalist and activist from Chhattisgarh who is based in Kanker. A press statement issued by Kanker police after the incident claimed there was a scuffle between Shukla and Dainik Srambindu’s Associate Editor Ganesh Tiwari and his associates Jitendra Singh Thakur, Maqbool Khan, Gaffar Memon due to some personal rivalry. The police press note claims Ganesh Tiwari is a journalist with little known publications Shrambindu and Amar Stambh ... 

**So when the matter is being investigated, with both the CM and Governor now involved, why the continuing hue and cry in the media?** 

**First**, this is an opportunity by the media to take pothots on Rahul Gandhi for his barb on them about always towing the Modi government's line (and it helps them meet their quota of anti-Gandhi and anti-Congress articles that earn brownie points with the government in power /s).

**Second**, Chattisgarh being a Congress state, is one of the few states where democracy still thrives and the media and activists can protest freely and more importantly **be heard** by the government. 

**Third**, and most important point, the Chattisgarh Congress party had promised to introduce a law to protect journalists. This law is being drafted and various committees are still discussing it but the media is impatient and rightly putting pressure on the government. 

**So all of you in the anti-congress bandwagon claiming that Congress or Rahul Gandhi is just as uncaring or undemocratic as the BJP are wrong.** The Congress, and Rahul Gandhi, like to speak through actions and it is doing so in Chattisgarh. **The media should protest for their rights, but shouldn't fudge the truth while doing so** - like the narrative that the Congress government is behind this attack 

But then, I fear even the media, like some of us ordinary indian citizens, have gotten so used to the dysfunctional democracy of the current regime that they've forgotten how a real democracy actually functions.",2020-10-12T19:15:08,/r/india/comments/j9lo2g/chhattisgarh_journalist_kamal_shuklas_health_is/g8kxt1u/,elgs4,7a293ae1-8f5e-4ba4-9c01-340e32b2f6a6,1760186818510192642

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karamchand_Gandhi

>The Gandhi family originated from the village of Kutiana in what was then Junagadh State.[2] In the late 17th or early 18th century, Lalji Gandhi moved to Porbandar and entered the service of its ruler, the Rana. Successive generations of the family served as civil servants in the state administration before Uttamchand, Karamchand's father, became diwan in the early 19th century under the then Rana of Porbandar, Khimojiraj.[2] In 1831, Rana Khimojiraj died suddenly and was succeeded by his 12-year-old only son, Vikmatji. As a result, Rana Khimojiraj's widow, Rani Rupaliba, became regent for her son. She soon fell out with Uttamchand and forced him to return to his ancestral village in Junagadh. While in Junagadh, Uttamchand appeared before its Nawab and saluted him with his left hand instead of his right, replying that his right hand was pledged to Porbandar's service.[2] In 1841, Vikmatji assumed the throne and reinstated Uttamchand as his diwan.

>Like his father, Uttamchand Gandhi, Karamchand had become a court official, or chief minister, of the local ruling prince of Porbandar. Karamchand's duties included advising the royal family of Porbandar and hiring other government officials.

>**Karamchand had very little formal education, but his knowledge and experience made him a good administrator.** He was said to be kind and generous, but also to have a bad temper.[3] **He learned from experience by watching his father work and attending religious ceremonies**. There were some areas, however, in which he never gained much knowledge, including geography and history. Nonetheless, Karamchand excelled as chief minister in Porbandar.[4]

TL;DR: Karamchand got opportunities that would have been denied to others with similarly low level of education simply because of his birth.

Middle class is not a title that others give you. It is based on your living standards and especially income. Gandhi's parents could afford keeping multiple servants and having him educated abroad. That's not what Middle Class do (but then half of India's high income people think that they are actually middle class, lol). 

As per Pew Research Centre, right now the middle class per capita in India earns between 10-20 USD per day. That puts the higher bracket at about INR 6lpa (on per capita basis, not per household basis).

The average Indians grossly overestimate middle class incomes. As per Pew, half of the high income group also self declares as middle class.

Marumakkathayam or matrilineal inheritance through nieces and nephews was the most important element of a Nair family. The ruling clans of Kerala styled themselves as Samantan or Samanta Kshatriyas and held names like Varma, Thampan, Thirupad/Thirumulpad, Thampuran, Raja, etc. Samantans and Samanta Kshatriyas were restricted to royal households and formed a very small amount of population. Even though they held higher social and ritualistic rank, they were of the same cultural stock as Nairs because they too followed the same marriage and inheritance system like Nairs and often intermarried with Nairs. Many prominent ruling Nair families also gradually adopted royal Kshatriya names. For instance, Rajas of Vadakkumkur and Thekkumkur kingdoms are recorded as Nairs  even though they have Varma name, Palakkad royalty to this day holds Shekhari Varma title while they are Nair-Menons , Koratti Kaimals of modern Thrissur district also styled themselves as Varmas .

>There were many powerful and influential Nair landlords and nobles under these ruling clans as well. For example Anjikaimals, Paliath Achans etc in Kochi, Ettuveettil Pillamar and other Nair Madampis in Travancore, various Nambiar and Nayanar clans in Malabar like Chuzhali Nambiar, Vengayil Nayanar, Kalliat Nambiar, etc. All of them owned vast amount of land and had their own soldiers under them.",2022-09-20T15:44:48,/r/india/comments/xif8wm/shashi_tharoor_set_to_run_for_congress_president/ip62oqz/,egg7e,22aa70a6-65d1-46fb-982a-a3c7a779a4b1,1760186882580283397

You and the other commenter have conflated caste and class. I stated earlier too that some members of the Nair caste were powerful and wealthy. But they were not members of the ruling __caste__. Some Nairs were huge landholders who were wealthy. That wealth, and the associated muscle power, and not their caste, gave them membership in the ruling class. That’s the difference. An impoverished Nampoothiri was still priestly class (and caste). An impoverished Nair on the other hand was not ruling (class or caste).

Jail or worse.

Common folks of this country do not value or deserve democratic rights. A 5 minute conversation with a fellow citizen should make it clear to anyone. They cheer on Govt excesses, extra judicial killings, blatant corruption while being slowly stripped of their fundamental rights. A Democracy demands its citizens to be vigilant and constantly hold the Govt accountable. It is a concept too good to be applied to this country.

> New Delhi: Farmers protesting for the last six months against the farm laws brought by the Bharatiya Janata Party government at the Centre have announced a "Defeat BJP: Mission Uttar Pradesh" campaign to be started ahead of the 2022 assembly elections in the state.

> Since the farmers' protest against the three farm laws began, there has been a political churn among farmers across the state, especially in its western districts such as Muzaffarnagar, Baghpat, Shamli and Saharanpur, to take on the BJP. Farmers protest against BJP leaders in Western Uttar Pradesh.

> D.P. Singh, another AIKS farmer leader and an active protestor at Ghazipur border, says that due to COVID-19, the union has not yet actively started the campaign against the BJP. However, he believes that it is the right time to start the campaign as certain communities that were pro-BJP, such as the Rajputs, have voted against BJP in panchayat polls.

> मर्यादा पुरुषोत्तम भगवान राम सर्वोत्तम मानवीय गुणों का स्वरूप हैं। वे हमारे मन की गहराइयों में बसी मानवता की मूल भावना हैं। राम प्रेम हैं वे कभी घृणा में प्रकट नहीं हो सकते राम करुणा हैं वे कभी क्रूरता में प्रकट नहीं हो सकते राम न्याय हैं वे कभी अन्याय में प्रकट नहीं हो सकते।

Roughly translated: *Bhagwan Ram is a symbol of the best humanitarian qualities and He (Ram) is in our deep consciousness. Ram is love, and doesn't side with hatred. Ram is compassion, and doesn't represent our cruel nature. Ram is justice and doesn't side with the injust.*

And this is the gist of the [longer statement Priyanka Gandhi](https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x7ve0bs) made:

> Ahead of Ram Mandir's 'Bhoomi pujan' to be held on Wednesday, Priyanka Gandhi has released her message on the occasion. Priyanka has described how Ram belongs to all and symbolises Unity and welfare of all. Priyanka said Bhoomi pujan' should bring a message of unity, solidarity and equality for all.

With the proper context, things should be more clear:

> Wouldn't this be counterproductive to the Congress party?

No. It's just a statement acknowledging the reality of today. The Supreme Court allowed the construction of the temple, and did not allow any more review petitions. For all purpose, the matter has ended now. 

> They're not going to pull the fanatic vote from the BJP.

The statement is not aimed at the fanatics.

> They lose the confidence and support of the minorities

Not really. The minorities know that it is still the Congress that speaks up for them in every platform.

> They sow more infighting within their own ranks (as if it wasn't bad enough already)

> *The world, and our own sub-continent's history and culture, bears the indelible imprint of Ramayana. The Indian psyche has always been inspired and encapsulated the spirit of Dharma, righteousness, duty, sacrifice, compassion, love, bravery and service, that runs through Ramayana - from north to south, from east to west, the 'Ramkatha' has manifested itself in immeasurable forms - just as the Lord has infinite incarnations, 'Ramkatha' has infinite forms.*

> *Ram is courage, Ram is unity, Ram is tolerance, Ram is fraternity. Ram belongs to everyone. Lord Ram is the good and well being of all. This is why Lord Ram is called 'Maryada Purshottam' (the epitome of principled conduct and righteousness).* 

> *Lord Ram symbolises sacrifice as also shelter. Ram belongs both to 'Sabri' as also to 'Sugriv'. Ram belong to 'Valmiki' as also to 'Bhasa'. Ram belongs to 'Kamban' as also to 'Ezhuthachan'. Ram belongs to 'Kabir', to 'Tulsidas' and to 'Raidas'. Ram personifies each one of us.*

> *Ram is an assimilation of all cultures, castes, class and religions and beyond any such barriers of language, regions or castes. Mahatma Gandhi's 'Raghupati Raghav Raja Ram' bestows divine wisdom and equanimity and Waris Ali Shah said, 'Rab is Ram'. Noted poet Maithali Sharan Gupt, described Ram as ""the strength of the oppressed and the voiceless"", while Mahapran Nirala described Lord Ram in his classical words as ""the power of eternal truth"".*

> *The 'Bhoomi poojan' ceremony of Ram Mandir in Ayodhya has been scheduled for August 5. Hope this event becomes a celebration of national unity, brotherhood and cultural harmony in accordance with the message of Lord Ram and with his blessings.*

Even Lincoln himself has specifically stated that he did not think black people were equal to white people. 

Also, emancipation was never on the table till near the end of the civil war, when Lincoln had decided that public opinion was good enough for him to present it. Till then his platform was that he only wanted to stop the spread of slavery.

How could a less than 4-6 years of imprisonment be enough for a mastermind of sex scandal involving 250+ girls being raped by Muslims? And just now they release rape-murder just on the base of lack of sufficient proof, even defendant advocate said that the guy just killed didn't slaughter her shows that guys are good in nature and deserve 2nd chance


Now coming to me if the people from opposition and the muslim community willing keep forgetting about mentioning about what happened in Godhara when they mention about Gujarat riots then wouldn't care about any Bilkis Bano and as matter of fact people served nearly 14-15 years in Jail but what about those Chisti brothers of Ajmer who alone three destroyed lives of 250+ hindu girls they didn't serve jail time till 15 years and then when they got jail time the court felt they served enough what about the uproar in that case I don't see anybody talking about morality in that case. Nobody gives shit about  Kashmiri pandits being brutalised and their women being even courts don't think about prosecuting people after 30 years but no uproar about it why?

No system is perfect. I'm very much against the slow, opaque collegiate system that allows for judges to exert huge amounts of nepotism. There are many changes to be made to our system. We need to have a system that acknowledges conflict of interest. We need to appoint judges on an ad hoc basis to fill up vacancies. We need to make a less convoluted system for lower court judges to be elevated on the basis of performance. But we chose instead to muddle judicial independence.

1. Delhi is a city state of 2 Cr people and you are right we aren’t a large number compared to the 135 Cr strong Indian population. However, we are also the 2nd biggest contributor to the GDP of this country so by your logic, everyone from every other state should shut their pie hole and sit down until they start contributing close to if not at par with Delhi. 

2. To your point of freebies. Because you’re a victim of propaganda spread by a certain party of which most of this sub seems to be blindly fanboying, let me enlighten you to some facts. The electricity subsidy you refer to is only free upto 200 units, a 50% subsidy (upto ₹800) is available upto 400 units and if anyone consumes even 401 units or more, they are liable to pay the full bill. Also please note, the per unit cost of electricity in Delhi is also one of the highest in the country. Hence, myth busted. 

3. Statehood isn’t some candy in the store that Delhiites are wanting because it is there to be had. Unlike any other state in the country, we do not have any reservation for our youth in our own universities. In fact, there are reservations of all sorts that take up more than 51% seats in our colleges and leave only a handful of seats for our children to scrape for. Put that into perspective with my first point about us contributing to the GDP. We’re not just literally carrying many other states, we’re also paying for our own children to be cheated of a quality education in colleges that we’ve paid for. Do you see how stupid that sounds? The same logic applies to government jobs. Just because you take the benefits of statehood for granted because you probably come from a state that has them doesn’t give you any right to preach to Delhiites about what they deserve. 

Baat realistic aur unrealistic ki nahi hai. Baat manifesto ki ho rahee hai aur agar itna hee unrealistic hai ye toh uska vaada BJP ko kabhi karna hee nahi chahiye tha aur agar kiya hai toh just because they aren’t in power at the state, they shouldn’t block it just because they place shady politics and childish power games over the betterment of people of Delhi. This is exactly why people here don’t vote for them.

Free speech is freedom from the government for speech. If the country doesn't like your speech there is little choice to change countries. Further they can put you in jail for it. Something which twitter can't do. 

Free speech from the government exists to protect novel ideas good or bad from the majority. So we should never move towards FoE as determined by the government.

The entire narrative of the opposition has been that ""freedom"", ""democracy"", ""secularity"", were part of the old India and not the new India, which is entirely false, and needs to be called out as false.

Asking Twitter to appoint an officer within India is quite a normal request; Twitter has no problem appointing officers in the US (who have gone so far as to ban an American president, and many of his supporters) nor does it have any problem adhering to European or Australian laws and empowering individuals working for Twitter in those countries to take such decisions. It is only India where they demand all requests from the government be sent to the US, as if they are not capable of hiring Indians to make such decisions. It is perfectly reasonable for the government to tell Twitter they need to assign local officers to deal with incoming requests. None of the other companies have an issue with this. Google agreed. Facebook agreed. I mean who wouldn't, this is a perfectly reasonable request.

And no, it was not about dissent. It was about people spreading vaccine fearmongering, and people coordinating riots such as the one on republic day, using social media. The government has no problem with you guys posting things like ""modi is useless chaiwala"", ""chowkidar chor hai"", ""surgical strikes were a jumla"", etc, on social media.

The only reason Twitter was able to create so much drama out of this situation is thanks to individuals such as yourself, and the parties you guys support. In your brain, when you see that the Modi government have a disagreement with a foreign social media company, you view it as an opportunity to attack the government regardless of the merits of the situation.

Just because a government was elected doesn't mean that people who voted for them agree with all their actions. Democracy is not just elections. In the present case, big tech actions ofc may be wrong in many cases, their power doesn't even match up to the power of the state which decide the policy and legal structure of a country. Take an example you choose to give away your privacy to the state, which may be similar to how an individual using Facebook decides to use it while trading his personal info. While you have made a choice on your own to trust state more than companies, remember many of us didn't. We don't want the dilution of privacy. This is different as to tech companies in which if I don't agree with their privacy policy I can leave, because if I don't agree with indian government policy, then I can't do anything because every tech platform here will follow the government policy.

The founders may have political preference and they might not change easily, but their platform doesn't equate to it.

Court orders are needed but such orders can easily be provided even for investigation phase before and if the situation went to a trial.

These organisations adhered to GDPR so why shouldn't they adhere to laws of our country provided the laws are sane.

In many cases, the US government used zero day vulnerability to snoop into data, and didn't ask or take the user data from platforms, there also still the populace hated it. Obama was hounded on NSA spying. After which they had to reform and platforms under pressure reduced their co-operation. An example is apple refusing to open iphone.

In comparison to USA, we do lack a comprehensive legal statue and supporting laws to even the power imbalance towards individual and companies vis-a-vis the state. We also lack a strong judicial system to help in case of undue violation of privacy by the state.

I don't know what you mean by USA emergency tbh, If though the concern is domestic data being taken by US agencies then the solution is data localisation or higher level of encryption or using a domestic platform with servers based in India. In some cases to help in law and order, it could also be mutual sharing of data through mutual agreements to help law enforcement, where both sides can help each other.

Wrong. Search for McCarthy. They went after the communists everywhere. The visa application to the US actually had a question on association with any communist party.

> They beat there opponent because they were better than there opponent.

Wrong. Until Ronald Reagan appeared, the US was struggling. It was under Carter that the US embassy in Iran was stormed and the USSR walked into Afghanistan. Ronald Reagan was the person who decided to compete with the USSR and began the space based defence program. The USSR had no money to match it and eventually came to the bargaining table. Ronald Reagan was the president who decided to arm the rebels in Afghanistan. 

Of course, in hindsight, that caused a lot of problems later, but your thinking that the US did not do anything offensive to the USSR is plainly wrong.

> What do you think will happen when majority of Hindus will get radicalize and remain unemployed (by watching current economic situations and by increasing automation most probablythey will ) ? They will become the biggest national threat that India can imagine in its wildest dream.

Again, nonsense. Why did Gujarat grow after 2002? Why did Muslims vote for Modi there? What ""radicalisation"" did Hindus there undergo? The problem in India is that the ""secular"" politicians empower Muslim extremists for votes. This needs to be dealt with. 

India needs a conscious policy to deal with religions who require their followers to deny other faiths. This does not mean empowering mobs like Pakistan does. This means sending a message to those who kill for their religion of ideology.

Hindus can't radicalise on a large scale because there are too many diverse ideas within Hinduism. Radicalisation on a large scale is possible only in the Abrahmic faiths because they require the followers to deny the validity of other fatihs.",2021-12-06T00:40:46,/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/r9df3s/rajasthan_bjp_mla_sanjay_sharma_posted_this_on/hnc8px6/,4lrx4,57929dc7-2813-414e-9429-7e5350dfd02c,1760182034000510976

Do you read this comment? This is exactly what is going to happen once anyone from the congress umbrella comes to power.  They are waiting for the next opportunity.

The MVA tested it in Maharastra, the TMC is already doing it in Bengal and Congress brought in foreigners for sar tan se juda in Rajasthan. These are just small experiments. Once Congress or anyone from its eco-system comes to power, this is going to happen pan India.

This is why we need to keep them out till a real pro-India alternative is available. Till then we have no choice but to keep voting BJP.

Modi appears Hindu with rajababu style clothing at every instance to create an impression that he is a Hindu while doing shit about Hindu causes.

Imagine it takes hundred years to take back Ayodhya and now Kashi....
If it were Muslims, think how much time would it take to reclaim?

If Hindus were 10% as arseholes that communal Muslims are, Muslims would keep their heads down and mind their own business.

All my adult life, the issue always has been Hindu-Muslim and it will continue for the rest of my life because Muslims can easily be made chutiyas in the name of Islam and can made to pit against Hindus. Unless Muslims work hard to get out the cesspool they are in and get educated to come out of the ummah mindset, we will have the same story over and over.

And Islam/Christianity are predatory in nature. Hindus will have to work hard not to get their lot stolen cause numbers make the difference. Modi would happily wear a skullcap if Muslim numbers reach a significant percentage and Hindus cant bend Modi Ali even after taking him to power.

Nice point. First the low birth rate has a lot to do with being developed and it’s not specific to Europe. Any place that goes through development and see improvements in quality of life also see a sharp decline In birth rate and it’s not something specific to Europe. Even the developed Asian countries like Japan and South Korea are also facing low birth rate.
Lol maybe touch some grass before believing any random survey. I live in london and have extensively travelled to Europe so I do know how thing looks like there. The majority of people , especially the new generation is agnostic/atheist. The only reason you don’t see them in a survey because majority of time these survey are biased towards religious populations. Since majority of agnostic people don’t have any reason to participate in them. Also a lot of these people are Christian just by Name and haven’t been to church in there whole adult life. The only thing that they have connection is Christmas which is a cultural thigh. It’s same as how i am or a lot of Indian are Hindu by name but only connected to it culturally ( Diwali , holi etc).  So yeah majority of people are turning irreligious day by day. The only reason you don’t see that because it’s the religious minorities who are the loudest. Also religion have a lot less influence on politics here compare to India. Try to find a candidate who does campaign on religious ground and they will kicked out by public on the spot.

For example, Delhi Govt said Crackers are banned but Delhi Police is under HMO i.e. BJP. BJP could've said Kejri ki aisi ki taisi Delhi Police won't arrest anyone for bursting crackers or selling crackers. But it isn't happening. 




One of my old neighbors, a big time BJP brand Hindutvavadi who runs a grocery cum bakery shop thought Kejri ki aisi ki taisi he will sell crackers under the table. For him, selling crackers was vidroh against Anti-Hindus who are killing Diwali. Just 2 hours back his son called my dad and told that his father was picked up by the police and they are asking for 1 lakh rupees to not file an FIR against him and let everything slide. This is BJP run Delhi Police for you. BJP as no less responsibile for killing Diwali than AAP. Even the inherently anti-Hindu Congress govt didn't damage Diwali like BJP has done.

Himachalis won't vote for AAP on just freebies. It's the education, jobs and health they will vote for. Himachal has a very bad govt health sector. I have lost 3 family members coz of it and I've seen it firsthand. 2-3 major hospitals spread over the state. Tanda, IGMC and maybe an AIIMS here and there. People from shimla and nearby are sent to IGMC shimla from where they are sent to PGI Chandigarh. People from near dharamshala are sent to Tanda, then 8-10 hours away to IGMC shimla and then eventually to PGI. My cousin was admitted in Tanda during covid and he has seen dead bodies in washrooms with no one to take care of people. Lost my Granny before corona at the same hospital..after multiple arguments with the staff who were over worked, understaffed and didn't care. Broken windows in -2 cold in December kept the patients freezing in all wards. Cleanliness- I woukd rate it a negative 100. IGMC is a little better but only a little. HP is a hub for education but it's private and it's super expensive. Most students move to Chandigarh or Delhi. Also, that ""small shopkeeper"" might not need it coz he is a 4th or 5th gen businessman who has crores in his bank account. I know many many same size business owners who run small garment shops and small shops but are super rich. Himachal also has a job dearth like Uttarakhand, options are army or farming if you wanna stay in HP. Or study medical or engineering and move to Pune/Delhi GGN or Bangalore.

Feel free to correct me if I'm wrong but I do not think the act automatically confers citizenship onto those non-muslims. It simply alters their status and no longer declares them an illegal immigrant but i do not believe that is the same as conferring citizenship onto them. In fact, they need to undergo the process to obtain certificates as listed under the newly introduced section 6B wherein despite being no longer considered an illegal immigrant, you would have to either pass the citizenship requirements as per Section 5 of the Citizenship Act as it currently stands, or the process of naturalization under the Third Schedule after which you may be considered for citizenship as per such certificates as under 6B.

Note- I am in no way supportive of the bill. I believe it is in blatant disregard of Article 14 of the Constitution and should be struck down with due time. However, I do not think such speculations should be equated with fact. Facts are separate and speculations are separate.

After listening to some news from Sir Ravish Kumar I drafted some answer. Please spread awareness and make sure if you want to question yourself or if anybody else around you questions the above, you make them aware by sharing the following.

Answer -

 Like Amit Shah quoted, there are so many universities in India and only few protested. Not all.

Why don't you understand that, there were so many many many many peaceful protests in India (in non BJP states) and not all were this way? 

Also, not long ago, in revolt to the release of a movie we had people doing Violence and [attack School bus filled with kids](https://theprint.in/opinion/karni-sena-schoolbus-modi-padmaavat/31473/). 

Did Police Lathi charge then? Why now? Because we know who the violence was from.

Anyway, all this doesn't make these protests with Violence right.

It Also doesn't justify the use of ruthless violence against Students by Police inside their Universities. Only prisoners get beaten up this way. Not Students.

And at last -

I appeal the Protestors, please protest peacefully.

And I also request everybody to not abandon the cause because of a few such posts questioning your cause.

Only answer I could come up for some blind people is - Get well soon.

I realise, using the word Bhakt (devotee) is wrong for people such as these. So, it is better to use some other words for them. (I don't know. Keep a nice name.)

Please copy this and spread this across. Edit it so it looks better. But please do this. We need everybody to know the truth and not stand ideally frozen when some people ask such questions.

If it has not been imposed and the required documents have not been confirmed, how do you know they will require ""extraordinary proof"". 

Secondly, if an NRC is going to be imposed, it's going to be imposed on everyone, Hindus included.

While everything you state exists within the realm of possibility, you're just painting a worst case scenario mode and flagging it the very probable reality.

> Among our neighbouring countries, Sri Lanka has a track record of persecuting Tamils, Burma of persecuting Muslims, and China of persecuting Tibetans and Muslims. So no, those three countries are not special.

Sri Lankan persecution of Tamils was not a religious persecution. It was an ethnic persecution and there are refugees in Tamil Nadu and the Indian government has been sending them back to Sri Lanka after the end of the war. The GOI is building houses for them in Sri Lanka. 

Tibetans and Muslims - one's an ethnic group facing ethnic persecution from a state. One is a religious group, having a state, facing persecution and then coming to India for economic reasons. 

You have a point with Tibetans facing persecution in China. But CAB doesn't have to include everyone. It's just a new path open for religious and ethnic minorities that are indigenous to the subcontinent. 

I don't think you get the point of being a refugee. The idea is that when things settle down, you go back to your home country. Things got better in Sri Lanka, so they're going back. 

Things aren't going to get better in Pakistan or Bangladesh or Afghanistan because they've declared themselves Islamic states and follow a discriminatory religious law that applies to everyone. 

> In short, the act is discriminatory in nature as it clearly states that India is only interested in taking non-Muslim refugees from Afghanistan, Pakistan and Bangladesh.

Ethnicity is discriminatory in nature. Citizenship is discriminatory in nature. Ofcouse, who the state takes in as refugees will and should be discriminatory in nature and who we accept as citizens also! 

We don't have to accept each and every Tom, Dick and Harry that lands on our borders. We have the right to selectively deny *illegal migrants* the right to citizenship on any grounds whatsoever, even arbitrary. 

Everyone talks big about how we should take in ""all"" refugees. Where were you when even the minority refugees (Hindu, Sikhs, Christians and Parsis) were being killed in these countries? All this hue and cry just when the non-muslim illegal immigrants are given a path to citizenship.

The only people who are protesting that I can stand with are the people of Assam. They have been forced with the illegal Bangladeshis and have had to tolerate them and they shouldn't have to.

I request everybody to do their own research.

India is a country were millions of parsi's from Iran migrated (12-20th century), millions from afganistan (during their struggle with russia), from sri lanka, from bangladesh, from Tibet (China) and now from Burma. 

Do you know that most number of migrants come to India from Bangladesh and Pakistan? 

Please read the Citizenship act of 1955.  It clearly says who is an illegal immigrant. Any body who is in India without a valid passport is illegal. This new bill excludes the people in the 6 communities from being illegal. All Illegal immigrants should be deported. Now, every country has the right to decide who can migrate. For example, US has EB5 visa to stop poor people from coming in, other countries have point system based on education/age, then there is something called 'extreme vetting' for people from select countries. If India decides to relax immigration rules for minorities of these three countries, it is not discriminatory but a preference. These three countries are not secular countries. These are Islamic countries where Minorities are killed. There is no question about it. 

Did you know that in Assam, there are more refugees than assamees? Have you read about Assam Agitation? 

At this point, people who are protesting and throwing stones and burning buses, should educate themselves. Being secular does not mean you should illegal immigration.

It is easy to brand me a bhakt, or someone from quora or whatever...but educate yourself about our history...you do not have to go back several years...only upto 1947.",2019-12-20T09:55:09,/r/india/comments/ebdeup/an_attempt_to_address_the_list_of_simplified/fbfc3c4/,5hok1,a867bd17-1ab5-4e71-8638-2f1818debb1b,1760186379619270656

This is what NRC is all about.

If you manage to provide the necessary documents you will be registered as a citizen and if you cannot for whatever reason, you will be considered an illegal immigrant. Since a lot of underprivileged people cannot produce documentary evidence due to having no passports, unlikely to own ancestral properties and birth certificates were not mandatory before 1989, they can be labeled illegal regardless of how many centuries their ancestors have been in India. This is how 19+ lac people ended up being excluded from NRC in Assam and the central govt is well aware of it and that is how they probably got the idea for CAB.

So, now, the same exercise would be done on a national scale except this time people of all religions except Muslims will have a way out even if they are left out due to being unable to produce documentary evidence or even if they are really illegal barring a few exceptions.

**It discriminates against ALL muslims (persecuted or not) from anywhere.** 

- The NRC and CAA are two sides of the same coin when it comes to citizenship.

- **The NRC is ""exclusionary"" in nature** - it's job is to identify the illegal immigrants to India and **strip them of any indian citizenship** as they are foreigners illegally in India.

- **The CAA is ""inclusive"" in nature** - it's job is to **grant indian citizenship to some** of these illegal foreigners stripped of citizenship by NRC,  based only on their religion (targeted mainly at Hindus) and ""persecution"" status in three neighbouring muslim countries (Pak, Af, Bangla). 

- **The end result of NRC + CAA is that ALL muslims**, and some Hindus and Christians etc. **will end up in refugee camps**. But due to the stupid illogical selective criteria most of the non-muslim refugees from Pak, Af, Bangla will get citizenship only because they were ""lucky"" to be born as non-muslims in these country, while muslims and non-muslims from other countries will continue to suffer.

> I feel there is some merit to the point that giving citizenship to Muslims from Bangladesh Pakistan is not needed ... But please dont just say India is secular and it discriminates).

**Yes, India is secular. Yes, CAA discriminates. That is a fact.** CAA is highly discriminatory to ""other"" persecuted victims from the non-muslim countries. There is no reason to treat a (for e.g.) Hindu foreigner from a muslim country as more special than a Hindu foreigner from a Hindu or Buddhist country. It is just plain ridiculous - **they are all foreigners and the victims or the persecutors religion doesn't make them special in anyway**. 

**The persecuted are the persecuted. They all feel the same pain, fear, anger and hatred. They are all victims of some kind of identity politics. It is totally inhuman to subject them to even more identity politics in the one place they found some sanctuary and a bit of peace and hope. They are all same and deserve to be treated fairly.**

> Also, from what I can see, as of now the Indian Muslims are safe. 

This is not true - **if an Indian muslim**, like most of the undocumented poor or those whose documents have been missing or damaged due to a natural calamity, **is unable to produce any document to prove his citizenship then that muslim will face detention and possible forceful deportation** to some foreign muslim country according to the whims of the government.

A Hindu without document can still lie and say he is persecuted immigrant from Pak, Af or Bang and ask citizenship. A muslim will have no recourse. 

> Just saying secular and discrimination and Indian constitution is not an educated argument. 

Lol. Then what is? Someone's ""feelings"" on the matter? That is exactly what this is about - Do you believe and accept the constitution of India?

From my understanding(i could be wrong) what this statement essentially says, before now India would have zero refugees as we dont have to accept any as we are not party to any Convention or Protocol. Simple searches shows that India has freely accepted refugees from both Tibet and Sri Lanka. 

So saying that Muslims from 3 countries(or for that matter any person from any other country) would not legally be able to get refugee status and then sub-sequently be able to apply for Indian Citizenship is incorrect.

Also from the page of the Indian National Bar Association([https://www.indianbarassociation.org/indias-refugee-policy/](https://www.indianbarassociation.org/indias-refugee-policy/))

*The State shall not deny to \*\*any person\*\* equality before the law or the equal protection of the laws within the territory of India Prohibition of discrimination on grounds of \*\*religion\*\*, race, caste, sex or place of birth”*

Instead of addressing the article, Salve deflected by saying it has nothing to do with the constitution because ""it's a matter of policy"" and ""courts do not second guess wisdom of legislation"". The last statement is positively facist.

Also I haven't seen the RSTV video you linked -- it's 28 mins long!

All Ahmadis did not go to Pakistan, many chose to remain in India, where they are considered Muslims by law. Those that did go to Pakistan went for three reasons:

1. the author of the Lahore Resolution that states Muslim-majority regions should be independent, was Muhammad Zafarullah Khan, a president of Int'l Court of Justice, whose father was a companion of the founder of the Ahmadiyya movement;
2. the successor of Ahmad, the founder, told his followers to support the Muslim League and (through the cleric of the Ahmadiyya community in England) made Jinnah agree to return to India;
3. the Ahmadis were allowed to found a city, Rabwah, in Punjab, Pakistan, in 1948.

These reasons gave the Ahmadis a false sense of security in Pakistan, but the religious persecution soon started, with an anti-Ahmadi riot as early as in 1953. So, in short, the Muslim League pretended to represent them ('cause religion) but all they wanted was support. Once they got that, they fucked them over.

​

Articles 14 ~~and 15~~ gives any person (not just Indian citizens) equality before the law ~~and protection from discrimination based on religion etc., respectively~~. Both of them are in Part III of the Constitution, which are *Fundamental Rights*. **Any** law the Government/Parliament makes is subject to Fundamental Rights, and as such any law discriminating based on religion (as CAA explicitly does) is *void* (Article 13(2)). So CAA is unconstitutional.

​

Any oppressed people, be it Palestinians, Kurds, or even Indians during the Raj, have radical elements prone to violence (think Bhagat Singh, Khudiram Bose or Aurobindo Ghose), which both results from and is directed towards the oppressor. Once the oppression ends, so do the radical activities. The radical Mukti Bahini of Bangladesh stopped its activities only after they gained independence from Pakistan, in which India played a big role. As the most powerful country in South Asia, we have a responsibility to preserve the peace in our region. This can only be done by liberating the Rohingya, and with our help they will stop their radical acts, just like Indian freedom fighters or the Mukti Bahini.

This is the core principle of the bill.

So yes, we are giving citizenship to undocumented refugees. 


>The BJP will then impose a nationwide-NRC. 

Amit Shah has claimed this multiple times. It was also in BJP's manifesto. 

> Indian Muslims will now require extraordinary proof to prove their Indian citizenship.

If we go by the Assam NRC, the burden of proof is on the citizen to prove his citizenship. Given that their is no preferential treatment to them (unlike other religions), Muslims will indeed need to provide extraordinary proof to prove their citizenship. It will also be trivial for the government to harass them.

I have the same concern as you do. To get a clearer idea I made a post but it didn't get much attention and I don't know who to turn to understand it better. The basic idea is that illegal immigrants of the particular religions are exempted from having a passport or other travel documents with them. This is from a previous amendment. They are also exempted from the onus of having to prove that they are foreign nationals. Perhaps you have a better grasp over the matter and can help me with it.

There are MANY hindus and privileged people who do not have the documents that is required by the NRC.

The requirements are equivalent to the ones that is needed for OCI card, i.e. Overseas Citizenship Identification card, when you acquire a citizenship of another country (say USA) and need like a permanent visa for India because you were born here.

- Once you claim that, the intelligence agencies will interrogate you.
- Only if they believe and verify your story will you be granted citizenship. 
- Bangladesi Hindus can qualify under this clause as Bangladesh is listed in the CAA.
- But all these Bangladesi Hindus in Assam have already either claimed to be persecuted victims or claimed to be indians.

- So now, after CAA all those who lied they were indians but couldn't prove it, will now have to lie and tell a new story - that they are not indians, but foreigners and persecuted victims of evil Bangladesi muslims - to get citizenship under CAA.

>never actually read of the article

They should have read it but that's not where discussion lies, as it allows for a reasonable classification and how it can be interpreted. Merely stating the article is not enough.

In order to pass the test of a reasonable classification, two conditions must be fulfilled, namely,

1. that the classification must be founded on an **intelligible differentia** which distinguishes those that are grouped together from others and
2. that that differentia must have a rational relation to the object sought to be achieved by the Act.""

Salve's arguments were that the distinction as an intelligible differentia between these 6 communities and other communities (in those countries) is that these 6 were minority in the said countries.  I do not believe this is an intelligible differentia but not sure.

Point 1 is solid and I think everyone will agree with him.

In point 2, he says that if changes were undertaken in the Citizenship Act of 1955 on the basis of religion, then that would have been problematic. This I also agree with.

Then he says: ""Existing citizens and citizens under Articles 5 to 11 \[Part II: Citizenship\] can not be discriminated against on the basis of religion in the eyes of the law...."" He is referring to Article 14, which says that *any person*, and not just citizens of India, are equal before the eyes of the law. (I included Article 15 in my previous comment, that's not true. Only Article 14 is applicable here.)

He continues, ""....but vestation \[*sic*\] of citizenship is different from existing citizens.... when somebody enters the country you have a right to actually impose certain conditions."" If those conditions make them unequal before the eyes of the law, then they violate Article 14.

India's problem of illegal immigration is barely a dent. Illegal immigration is a bigger problem in western countries, and it took them years and years to implement a well defined system (which still gets criticized btw) as per which they will process illegal immigrants. India does not even have an agreement with neighbouring countries to process the illegals, let alone a system to register 1.2b people properly. Assam was a pilot project and it was a disaster with many people stuck in detention camp because they did not have the documents the government is asking for (which is really difficult to get for a lot of people btw). And can we also not forget that just a couple of years ago we were told Aaadhar card is the most important thing we need, and we need to link it with everything. 6,000 crore was spent on implementing Aadhaar, and now suddenly Aadhaar, Passport, and even Voters Id is not enough. So, who is to say they won't change the rules again in some time. 

And with all due respect, India is not USA, UK, Canada etc. that people are dying to come to India because it is so good. Illegal immigrants come here because they are running away from something. Yes, some of them are bad, just like many Indians create nuisance abroad (scams, fake degrees etc.) but that is a crimr problem, and there are already laws to deal with it. Rest of the people are not a danger (immediate or otherwise) to India. But yes, they should be removed or processed, but as I said, there are MUCH better ways to do it instead of NRC.

In 2016, we were told demonetization was an absolute necessary step to eradicate black money and fake currency. What happened? As per RBI's report and several BJP minister's own admission, most of the money came back into the system. And the promise of ""Give me just 50 days, and I will give you a golden India"" is something that was conveniently forgotten. The whole move led to many small businesses being shut down, and many labourers and farmers losing a lot of money, and there was no tangible upside to it, at least not enough to warrant such a drastic move.

A country like India which is developing, should not be making sensational sweeping changes every 2nd year, it is a negative influence on the market and the economy.

Illegal immigration is a problem, and certainly not what I want, but there is a reason many countries across the globe have struggled against it. It is not a problem with an easy answer. And in India, there are way bigger problems that we have to address than this. A government has to consider all possible consequences of a decision and weigh the pros and cons. Even demonetization was not a bad decision in itself, but it was so obvious that it was just not worth the effort; it created so much chaos for very little returns.",2019-12-20T22:28:56,/r/india/comments/ebdeup/an_attempt_to_address_the_list_of_simplified/fbgkpqu/,2o2vl3xq,7ff137ee-cede-4c32-9ad5-7bebfad21afc,1760186379638145024

In A US Congress hearing against Twitter (a US company) - Modi govt cant hide under their usual ""dont interfere in our internal matter"" nonsense. 

Let it come out , exactly who from the govt asked Twitter to take it down. Let it be known to the whole world what kind of monsters run the Indian government, where during a national red alert crisis, they are more focussed on controlling and censoring the news , rather than solving the situation. 

If I am not wrong, many Democrats have come out in the open to slam Modi government on various points, most recently on the farmers protest issue. However what is currently going on (suppressing news on Twitter, threatening students and online volunteer groups from carrying out community help ) is a completely despicable act , I think more people find out about this,  that Indian govt is threatening Twitter and preventing people from actually knowing about whats going on in the country, more Modi govt's reputation will sink to a level beyond which any goodwill that Modi govt has created in its foreign relations would simply disappear and Modi's govt will be seen as non grata.


I think in asking Twitter to suppress such news, Indian govt hasn't thought about the fall out of such moves. Indian govt does things in a heavy handed way, but maybe this time they are forgetting that the world is interconnected, and COVID19 situation isnt just a farmer issue or or CAA protest, but a national healthcare emergency which is resulting in thousands of death every day, and suppressing the truth about this is nothing but unforgivable crimes against its own citizens.

There is absolutely no problem in choosing the best for your own life. Americans didn't move to a better country for a better life because they were already getting what they wanted in their own country. You think all those people from first world countries who are against immigration would stay in their country had things been worse for them? No. Many would move to greener pastures when they get a chance. Humans have been migrating from place to place since the beginning. Why is it such a bad thing to leave your country all of a sudden? Back in the day people used to stay in their hometowns their entire life. Nowadays, an increasing number of people leave their hometowns or home state looking for better jobs or better life. Nobody bats an eye because it is within the country. 

>Lot of Indians, definitely want easy way out, instead of staying back and fighting and fixing things. 

Honestly speaking, what do you think is gonna change if all those students stay within the country? What kind of positive change are you expecting? It's just wishful thinking at best. India's problems are not going to be solved just by having all those people stay within the country. If we need to solve the brain drain problem, we need to make it worthwhile for the people who are staying. Making people sacrifice better life opportunities for absolutely nothing leads to just bitter people with regrets. We already have a large population with unemployment issues. What is the point in all those people staying in India. And to infer that it's the easy way out for everyone is wrong. A lot of people take huge risks, at least in terms of loans, to go via that route.

Congress is supporting it because it is Congress ruled state and they have leverage here, and Akali Dal because the Badals have a major stake in the current Anaj-Mandi procurement system - a stake which some say runs into thousands of crores.

I'll try my best to simplify the political situation in my state. 

It's true that majority of people here don't like BJP (especially Modi). They have completely neglected and ignored Punjab from past 3-4 years and the business families suffered a lot due to Demonetization and GST Implementation. 

However, BJP actually never focused on Punjab. The answer for this is pretty simple - Demographics.

Majority of Punjabis are Sikhs and BJP's policy for Punjab was basically to let Akali Dal do their thing. They would get a fixed quota of seats to contest on (mostly in Northern Districts like Pathankot). They are still politically active in almost all districts but only the Akali candidates used to be on the ballot. That changes now.

But, the last term of Badal's (2012-17) was the worst ever in Punjab's history (excluding the insurgency period). They freely let the Drug trade happen and even their politicians are accused of being involved in it for money. There was corruption, nepotism and high debts. However, the most defining moment was the Bargari Sacrilege Case.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_Guru_Granth_Sahib_desecration_controversy

It turned out that the Akali's were trying their best to undermine the investigations and even 2 protestors were killed by police in protest. There was no way, they were going to retain control anymore. Also, their alleged links with Dera Sacha Sauda (who are supposedly their votebank) has also raised eyebrows. 

In 2017, we had 3 parties fighting for control. AAP had a new base but failed to capitalize on the opportunity. Congress did better than expected and won the elections. 

But again, don't assume that our people are ""fans"" of Rahul Gandhi (or infact any Gandhi's). 

Most Sikhs hate them a lot for what they did to our community in 1980's. Mass killings, Fake encounters and the Delhi Genocide caused a lot of hurt to the community. If people had to vote for Congress this time, they did it out of complete desperation. Also, the Sikh vote was actually divided among all 3 parties. Most Punjabi Hindus did vote for Congress which was a big factor as well. The credit for Congress victory goes more to Captain Amrinder Singh than to Rahul Gandhi. 

Now, Congress isn't doing any better as well. Drugs are still a problem and Corruption is there. Things have only 'marginally' improved. But in the end, it's the hate for BJP and Modi that is making people vote for Congress (not because they like Gandhi's). 

It's basically like choosing the lesser of the 2 evils. 2 genocidal parties. 

Just because Congress is winning, don't think that we have forgiven them for what they did in 1984.

Over here, people have noticed how BJP has been completely ignoring Punjab in the past 3-4 years. BJP's policy regarding Punjab was pretty simple - ""Let the Akali's do their thing"". 

However, the final term of Prakash Singh Badal was so horrible that there was no way they were going to win anymore. Most Sikhs in Punjab still hate and detest Congress after whatever they did in the 80's, but the Akali's have basically forced them to vote either for Congress or AAP. 

It's like choosing the lesser evil. Again,as per my interactions with people in my area, it's pretty clear that people hate both Rahul Gandhi and Narendra Modi.

I can openly say that most Punjabis are disillusioned with politics (both Central and State Level). State Governments don't care about us at all and only want to fill their pockets. Most farmers also don't want any political interference and just want assurance of their needs. I'll be careful with both Modi and Rahul Gandhi.

2. Your opinion about congress is just a result of you being brainwashed by mainstream media and IT cell propaganda who don't tell about congress's actual impressive achievements which actually led to people taking our country seriously. Surely there were some negatives too, but overall it was a decent enough party.


3. That's a rather suspicious and elaborate rant about why particularly you don't support AAP. Anyways, even if AAP is using tax money(much more efficiently than any other party I might add) at least it's not wasting it on building pointless statues and mandirs, it is at least giving it back to the people itself. And that's selfish to say that why should your tax money go to welfare of other people, knowing how much it actually helps people in need. It's unfortunate that even your ""educated"" doctor family has lost its humanity in pure selfishness. I hope more doctors don't feel the same way as that's a scary mentality for someone to have who's job is to help people.

His larger point has valid grounds as well. It's only the job of the legislature branch to debate and pass laws, the judiciary's job is to only interpret the law and provide judgement, it can neither 'enact' nor 'pass' laws by itself.

Your poor understanding is not my problem. Your whole point was that Pariament can't dictate who they should give benefits to, which is just bullshit. Parliament already gives more right to OBC, SC and ST. And Parliament has all the rights to decide what govt benefits are given to different sections of people.

No such ""normal"" phenomena existed even in india( to remind you hijras are biologically intersex not trans-men or trans-women). I don't worship Matt Walsh or someone else, I'm atheist and disagree with him on abortion, god, gay rights etc. But it doesn't mean if I'm anti-right then i will accept everything bullshit spewed by woke left like a sheep. Everything must be questioned no matter which side says it. A muslim guy talking about pedophilia, gimme a Break. It's mostly muslim apologetics who have to defend this practice frequently in debates due to their prophet and sunnah. What these ""western conservatives"" will do if involved me has nothing to do with agreeing or disagreeing with a view. It's not some tribal conflict, where you have to choose your own group opinion just because they are yours. Ideas are judged based on their worth and rationale not on the personality of their supporters. Matt Walsh might threaten to kill me but it doesn't mean that his documentary will lose credit because of it. Get out of political Tribalism. Now, you are talking about disability as expected. Go read the meaning of disability. Losing an organ, losing testosterone producing parts, is indeed a disability. But it doesn't matter, the whole premise as I have told before is based on ""my body my rights"" ""my feelings"" , ""primacy of self identification"". So, i don't think it's wrong with this standard to fulfill the wish of thousands of people suffer from body dysmorphia who wants to lose some body parts to make them feel comfortable and confident with their personality. Slippery slope isn't it. It's so convenient to mark something as disorder while other as choice based on ideology.

Seems like more than one problem can be dealt with simultaneously.

Also, frankly, no one bursts crackers because 'it is the tradition', I'm quite sure. At least, most of us. We (used to) burst crackers because it was FUN. That's it, and it gives us a sense of nostalgia. Idk, I can't make claims that crackers were mentioned in any of holy scriptures or not because a lot of times, lines in scriptures are poetic and may be metaphorical too, but it's really not like we follow scriptures to the T, right? Come on. 

Small aspects of cultures change with changing times and changing needs, and Delhi is specifically vulnerable since it already has high levels of air pollution. So, any reduction helps. Why not? We anyway can celebrate with Diyas, Kandils, Rangoli, and sweets. Let's retain the good aspects of our religion, right?  Besides, Asthmatics and Dogs won't face problems too.

Firecrackers shouldn't be banned because a report from a study partially funded by IIT Delhi ( and the other half by Ministry of Education (which is slightly sus) said that biomass burning is a bigger factor (Anyone wanting to read the report, tell me i'll post it in the thread).

However, this study is not peer reviewed, now this may not be a big deal and the results may really be accurate, but getting studies reviewed is important.

On the other hand, they can just organise certain places for celebration if they are worried about road safety of people ( which is a completely valid concern)

It was partly funded by IIT-Delhi and the Ministry of Education, and was conducted as a part of a collaboration between IIT-Delhi, IIT-Kanpur and PRL Ahmedabad.
According to a statement by the institute, researchers found that the metal content in PM2.5 levels rose by 1,100% during Diwali, and that fireworks alone accounted for 95% of the metal, but the impact of fireworks plummetted in around 12 hours.

In 2021 Modi and BJP both shared a post with hashtag Darkdaysofemergency blaming Indhira Gandhi for the ban back in 1975 and the ban on freedom of speech in the process. And now the same people bans the documentary,  conducts raids as a means of getting revenge and finally they decide to use the very same situation they criticized in 2021 just to justify their ban.

You do more to hurt your argument than to support it by mentioning actions from indira’s time that match perfectly to Modi’s.  


Just like indira and the trade unions, Modi too has taken over government institutions like CBI, ED, election commission, etc.

Modi’s recent symbol has become the bulldozer for demolishing poor people’s homes especially the minorities. This is an exact parallel to Sanjay Gandhi’s beautification of the cities.

Similarly, We rank the lowest in press freedom. Every news channel sings the same tune and even NDTV has been bought now and the change in their tone is brutally visible. Even Nepal, bhutan and Afghanistan rank above us. Activists and Journalists are thrown in jails for speaking against their policies and termed terrorists at the drop of a hat.

Also all the income tax raids are strategically launched. There’s no implication of a routine or it isn’t a simple coincidence that they just happen to raid BBC after the documentary dropped. And BBC isn’t free of hypocrisy and blame but the contents of the documentary hold some truth if not all of it. Otherwise modi wouldn’t have banned it. It’s not like a mere documentary can be a threat to the stability of our nation where on the other hand you have sadhus shouting through speakers about killing muslims in broad daylight in Delhi. 

Modi never addresses the rise of communal violence and tension in this country. It’s actually the people of his party that are given all the freedom to cause chaos and tension and he’s willfully blind to it all.

Also dude didn’t conduct a single press conference in both his terms as prime minister.Modi is actually indira on steroids and some cocaine too considering how slick he is with maintaining public perception. There’s literally news segments spanning hours talking about the size of his chest or how he paused the ukraine-russia conflict to evacuate the students.

That's good, but you should see some people I know who would defend anything and give strawman arguments. But I digress.


Regarding the TN news you mentioned, I haven't followed it well, so will get back after I go through it properly. But from what you've said, that seems extremely wrong. But right now, I'm not sure if the media were actually curtailed to not let out the news, is there a recent history of media dissent by the state government in TN. To get answers to those qns, I would have to read a bit.

>And it's not only this country , its everywhere

I might not agree here fully. If you compare the media in the US, there aren't a lot of crackdowns on media houses. A comedian Hasan Minhaj, Indian ethnicity and a religious minority but still manages to run a political show and has criticised the US government without a scratch on him. A lot of media outlets can use strong language against even their president, something for which you could go to jail here.

I'm not saying we should follow suit, but there should be room for healthy dissent and the government should answer those qns. Also, opposition's role is to ensure the government is kept on its toes. Issues like BBC or Adani fiasco should be raised and govt should be forced to answer. There could be some lame ass arguments raised by opp, which shouldn't be done but it's not the worst thing in the world.",2023-02-16T17:52:50,/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/113k1jh/when_indira_gandhi_cracked_down_on_bbc/j8r23kt/,1ghrpcu,c0417b4a-d199-4f48-b545-cbad2d3787a6,1760183277725941760
113k1jh,When Indira Gandhi cracked down on BBC,3d4x4,t5_3d4x4,j9bx07p,"Bruh CPI and RSS are the two parties that fight amongst themselves in both the states you mentioned. RSS is ideologically active and they’re known to escalate matters. Although it isn’t right to kill anyone but RSS members being attacked doesn’t really makes one beg for answers or reasons as to why it happened. 

In contrast the bjp along with bajrang dal and the state police have been found to have direct involvement in communal riots. A recent example would be the Delhi riots where cops made some injured and unarmed civilians sing the national anthem when they could barely walk and later one of them died from his injuries and all this is on video. This is what makes it a fascist state. Breaking into a library and attacking unarmed students. When did this ever happen before 2014? And assuming it did, doesn’t mean that it’s okay if it’s still happening. 

More than exposing someone’s hypocrisy you end up highlighting your own lack of sense when you keep bringing up remotely comparable examples to justify your view. Also I could be equally opposed to the communist party and the bjp at the same time. Where’s the hypocrisy there? Blinded by an ideology and for what? 

Open yourself up to the entire picture. Being possessed by an ideology will only let you see through a keyhole.

which are totally law and order problems and have nothing to do with religion

""intolerance"" in a country where Madarsas brainwash children to hate idol worshipping polytheistic pagans (Koran 9:5, 9:29, 3:28, 4:11, 21:98 and other similar verses) and government funds these 'religious institutions'

""secularism"" in a country where non- muslims cannot manage mosques and non- christians can't manage churches but for Hindus:

**Our Temples do not belong to us.** In most of the states, Governments have passed acts and legislations to take over Hindu institutions including Temples, Mutts and Endowments. This has enabled the Government to interfere in the Temples’ management, practices and rituals. Not just that, Temples’ properties and income have also been usurped by the Government. The most outrageous fact is that the Government exerts such a control exclusively on the Hindu Temples; the places of worship of other religions enjoy freedom and autonomy. This is a clear-cut case of systematic discrimination and harassment.

From education to ecology and culture to charity, Hindu Temples have played a pivotal role in shaping the Indian society. Today’s India has become a battleground for the clash of civilizations, and the Hindu society is facing an existential threat. The need to revive the Temple eco-system is more important than ever. But this cannot be achieved without freeing them from the clutches of the State.

The Government’s control over the Hindu Temples is unconstitutional and immoral. Hindu Temples belong to the Hindu society and the State must exit immediately.

While the state governments control over 4 lakh out of an estimated 9 lakh temples across the country, there is no such control over Muslim and Christian religious bodies. In this backdrop, there are demands to amend “The Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments (HRCE) Act 1951”, which allows the state governments to take over temples and maintain complete control over them and their properties.

There are over 15 state governments which control only Hindu religious institutions, specifically temples—right from the appointment of administrators to mandatory collection of 13-18% service charge. This takes away the community’s right and resources to protect its interests. This, according to them, is discriminatory as only Hindu community suffers this kind of treatment. It violates the concept of secularism. Also, the Indian Constitution does not permit the State to run religious institutions.

Those advocating for equality say that the process of taking control of temple riches was started by the Mughals and was followed by the British rulers. After Independence, the Jawaharlal Nehru government continued with the policy of controlling the temples by enacting the HRCE Act in 1951. “To the contrary, there is no such control over mosques and churches. We demand that in the same way, temples should also be freed from any kind of control. The government must amend the Act, which is the root cause of the problem,” said J. Sai Deepak, noted Supreme Court lawyer. He also pointed out that traditionally also the “Raja” (king) does not have the right over the wealth of the temple.

*How could Indian courts recognise Sharia-based Muslim Personal Law while claiming to be secular? How could Central and State governments take over the management of Hindu temples if they were secular? How could a secular government provide financial assistance to educational institutions run by religious organisations? How could a secular government codify and modify Hindu personal law? How would the government extend the existing caste-based reservations to minority religions if it were secular?*",2021-05-03T12:19:05,/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/n3fvao/payal_mehta_violence_caught_on_cctv_said_to_be/gwqvmer/,-1,0173eced-beca-4ef9-bc86-5b3c1d165bbe,1760183066783907840

The above is my position.

A person that is ""not"" proud of their nazi ancestor will not identify themselves as nazi-german or nazi-jewish mixed-heritage individual. A 3rd generation descendent of KKK member who is born to black & white parents (mixed race), will not identify the ""KKK"" aspect of their ancestry.

The very fact that a person ""chooses"" to ""identify"" themselves with particular aspects of their ancestry (such as nazi, or KKK, or other invasive species) is of & by itself evidence that they ""value"" that part of their ancestry. And a modern day german who values their nazi ancestry, or a modern day white person who values their KKK ancestry, is being racist (in doing so).

Please note: I'm not saying they MUST NOT value the nazi or KKK parts of their ancestry - I'm only saying that the very action of valuing (be it by adding it as a prefix, or by identifying it, or by other means) is inherently racist.",2023-03-04T02:17:18,/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/11g18n6/today_i_learned_that_congress_ammended_the/jas9gu4/,qz58daj2,dc772017-8f62-4a2f-bf4b-03fc021e97df,1760183026196676608

(...) The receptive powers of the masses are very restricted, and their understanding is feeble. On the other hand, they quickly forget. Such being the case, all effective propaganda must be confined to a few bare essentials and those must be expressed as far as possible in stereotyped formulas. These slogans should be persistently repeated until the very last individual has come to grasp the idea that has been put forward. (...) Every change that is made in the subject of a propagandist message must always emphasize the same conclusion.

You first started calling out protestors for not knowing why they are protesting. Then you got called or for not knowing what you're talking about. Then you posted this fact. With enough number of qualifiers, this will be true. But you know very well that it isn't actually true in the sense that you want people to believe it.

Here's the detention centre your probably referring to:


https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/assam-detention-centre-inside-indias-1st-detention-centre-for-illegal-immigrants-after-nrc-school-ho-2099626

But even just a cursory look at wikipedia tells you that Assam alone has 6 operational detention centre and plans are in place for 10.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assam_Detention_Centre

These numbers are obviously too small, given the 1.9 million potential detainees. What do you think the government is going to do after your ""one"" detention centre is filled?

The central government has officially asked every state and union territory to build detention centres:

It's gray, and that's how it will be. Your idealism doesn't work in reality. Bangladeshi and Pakistani immgrants aren't the same. One is legal and had to go through the atrocities of partition. While the other is an illegally infiltrated immigrant population of a completely different state. The cut off date across mainland India(yes I used mainland India for a lack of better term) is 1951 while in Assam it's 1971. We are in fact taking in 20 more years of immigrants than the rest of the India. We understand they were fleeing the atrocities of war and want to support them. Even if it's none of our business.

But boohoo, if you want to make me appear as the devil here by calling me out as privelaged. I could give two shits. Legal citizens of a country are fighting for their very identity and right to live. You wouldn't bate an eye to deny your fellow citizens their right, but want to open up our states and country to more people, who aren't Indians to begin with? Are you going to finance and house them? Cause sure as hell they wouldn't be able to sustain themselves as there aren't enough opportunities for Indians itself. There are already Indians struggling to get a job out there. You would want an illegal immigrant to come take their job? Of course they will be cheaper labpur than Indians and people would want more immigrant workers than Indian. But this means denying your fellow Indians their birthright. 

Also how do you expect the Bangladeshis to feed their families ? Do you suggest they beg or steal from your fellow citizens? You're maybe trying to think from an idealist viewpoint but it doesn't work in the world we live in. We aren't US or European nations who are already developed with proper infrastructure and able to sustain additional people. India is still underdeveloped. Especially the northeast. Millions of people are already displaced every year due to floods in Assam. They then come to temporary refugee camps on the Highway. The state highway which is still two lane.

You're absolutely right, they most certainly are. Movies are a piece of art and in as much as they can entertain, they can also provoke thought and serve in showing us a mirror.

However, the problem with these storytelling exercises is the sensitivity element. There's a good reason Benny Hill didn't do Schindler's List. 

There's a reason you don't hear too many recounting of tales during the time just generally referred to as *Gadar* because while part of our history, recounting of that time is just too horrific. It would be nigh impossible for anyone to make a movie whilst being objective over the entire unfolding of events.

I'll leave the below from Deccan Herald's review of the movie

> But as you watch this film, it becomes obvious that director Vivek Agnihotri is working on a very different agenda. Instead of sensitivity, you get horror that verges on the caricature; instead of tragedy, you get a shriek of propaganda; instead of a human story of displacement and wrong, you get a laundry list of the pet concerns of the Hindu Right; instead of a repudiation of hate, and an overriding sense of the colossal loss that divisiveness brings in its wake, you get an unsubtle incitement to still more hate.",2022-03-25T03:29:55,/r/india/comments/tmcun4/put_the_kashmir_files_on_youtube_everyone_will/i1yxno6/,9far6tp6,0599e565-85c2-4078-9b82-43b51b812510,1760184912397205511

Centre also made a statement that states weren't allowed to implement full lockdowns and restrict interstate travel.

Some of the state governments tried to do the right thing but were discouraged by the central government.

n07ph4,BBC grilling BJP spokesperson on censoring tweets criticizing the govt on covid.,2qh1q,t5_2qh1q,gw62pih,"You didn't misunderstand. This is sadly the viewpoint of the Indian government today. And to some extent, this is how our governments always have been. People appeal cases like these all the way to the supreme court, and the supreme court does end up overruling the government and rebuking it for violating Article 19 (freedom of speech) of our Constitution... but by the time justice is served, it's often months later and the temporary bans have already done their job successfully. 

Like, over the last one year, these are the reasons and justifications I've heard from spokespersons of the government for clamping down on social media:

1. Fake news (even when it's not)
2. ""Offending the sensibilities of religion X"" - almost any minor criticism (even legitimate) of religious practices (be it Muslim or Hindu) is often met with hostility.
3. ""Inciting violence"" - at this point, even someone saying ""we should flood the streets of Delhi and protest"" would end up getting booked under our IT act for 'inciting violence'. Whether or not they get convicted aside, the very fact that you can initially get arrested is a huge chilling effect on free speech. 

One incident that really stands out is the case of Disha Ravi - farmers in India were protesting a new law, and as a part of the protest Disha, along with a couple others were making a shared Google Doc with common talking points, template tweets and hashtags users could share and some press releases. The government of India arrested her on charges of sedition because 'the toolkit was used by foreign actors to influence domestic agenda to incite violence'. Who were these foreign actors? Celebrities like Greta Thunberg and Rihanna. 

At this point... I kinda feel sad about how ""anti-nationalist"" is commonly thrown around as a term for anyone who criticises the government. Maybe I'm going the other extreme, but the only day I'll accept India is really free... is the day someone could burn an Indian flag in New Delhi and not be charged (legally) as a criminal for burning it (unless they violate fire codes or their burning it harms other people there or if they do it with an illegal accelerant).

Extreme, I know. But the whole ""you're antinational and you can be arrested if you do X"" is a very slippery slope. We started out there - people who burn flags, support enemy states like Pakistan should be jailed. And slowly, we've devolved to this.  

If only we could go back.",2021-04-28T21:15:59,/r/india/comments/n07ph4/bbc_grilling_bjp_spokesperson_on_censoring_tweets/gw62pih/,6x7xktmo,7dc84b7a-0906-419d-bde6-ea3850b1ec41,1760184455387938816

There is yet to be a solution other than exclusion. Education is too slow and useless to take anything into account.  Also important to note that the situation of the country falls just because the people who should be using their brains act blindly in religious fervour. And this religion affects nearly all of India. One way or the other.

The population more than tripled since 1990, and with it the sensitive microclimate seems to have disappeared. Used to be a green and cool oasis through the year with good water supply. Despite the hot and desertified surrounding deccan plateau (drought-ridden anantapur/rayalaseema is very close to bangalore). Tree cover has reduced from over 50% to <2% of the city area (i.e. a 2500% decrease in 30 years). There were more than a hundred small lakes, which were either filled for land or dumped with waste.

My personal experience is from the 90s when it started to change (I've only rarely been to bangalore on brief visits since the early 00s). It was a small --- but growing --- city with cool weather (very cold in the winters), tree cover everywhere (beautiful jacarandas) and not so many people, this has mostly disappeared. 

I guess the question is whether bangalore was the best place for the boom to happen. Maybe it was, but it changed the city for the worse IMO.

In India we need to follow the 'ABM' model. Instead of Ab ki bar modi Sarkar, it has to be anyone but Modi.

And if we are looking for leaders, you have good leaders in Kejriwal and Naveen Patnaik. Kejriwal has done good work in delhi. It's a different thing that the centre is clipping his wings at every point. Delhiites swear by him..look how he won the majority in the last 2 elections. As for mr Patnaik - his credentials go a long way. He has shown expert leadership in managing the cyclone crisis that hits his states every year. The death tolls are negligible. And I just read an article on India Today on how Orissa is expertly handling the 2nd wave and sending oxygen to other states.

So yes, we do have leaders and options. But then the biggest question is how much clout can these regional leaders get before the 2024 elections to stand up against the national juggernaut that BJP has become.

Sadly no,this isnt the truth,Taking away one form of recreation always leads to another form taking its place.Also pubg as a diversion form work and cause for unemployment is just plane wrong.Games especially games like pubg are played on good and costly hardware ,they have to be bought by some cash,this cash is either provided by family of a young one or someone buys it with their own money,the monetisation system is also based on FOMO this means game insentivises the player to spend money ,combined with the need for good internet pubg will at the minimum cost you Rs140 to play a month through the minimum expense you have to play for a 4g internet.This means the average pubg player is either  taken care of by a guardian with no insentive to work or by someone who earns enought to spend on luxury.

Also ,games have been tested and researched on a lot to prove wether they cause some harm.There is a possiblity of addiction and lazyness but that is true of nearly every non-physical hobby.You can call your self a book worm and read twilight all day developing none of the skill same with games.Also game especially shooters are known to increase mental awareness,reflexes and attention to detail therefor a tool for increasing focous and skill.There is research that show games like league of legends are even more complex then games like chess.

Also ,counties that play most games are countries that are some of the richest and have least unemployment.eg-Canada,Japan even PUBG is more famous in South Korea  which is one of the best countries in this regard.Also games like pubg have made kids millionars and have given rise to jobs like professional gamers and youtubers ,jobs really not possible before.

The only takeaway from this or ""truth"" from this  is one failed government blaming other more failed government using thing that were not present in their time.With the ban hammer looming over every foregin app all this is giving is an escape to these stupid politicians to bann something and gain sympathy and goodwill because people find every anti-establishment and calim that appeals to data true.withouth resolving the real issues like communistic policies,excessive red tape, bad education,illetracy and lack of policies to support small bussiness , wide spread curroption ,and really personall and behavioural issues plaguing societies that stop them from taking jobs.",2020-07-28T23:20:32,/r/india/comments/hz9umz/modi_govt_wanted_to_ban_pubg_but_realised_youth/fziq87o/,7engpbwj,7e115ed9-b2b9-41bd-8fc3-78a54b185d28,1760185062524977156

There is a few layers of logical leaps in your comment that I won’t go into, because they aren’t relevant to this topic here, so I am just going to focus on the time bit and the addiction bit.

There’s no objective measure on what’s the _best_ way of spending your time, because it really differs for everyone under different contexts. Some people choose to spend time playing video games because that’s the most practical and cheapest option they have for acquiring entertainment; some do it because they find consolation in doing so; some others do it because it’s the only way for them to mentally escape from a dire situation they are in.

I happen to know a terminal cancer patient who did just that... how would you instruct a person who has only a few weeks to a month of lifetime left, who is too weak to do actually anything, and is already surrounded by family members, to “not lose the most precious thing in the universe” so that she could best spend her time? This is an extreme example, but it illustrates my point perfectly: what your definition of “best use of time” and values are only as relevant as to the person having to deal with all the factors in life as you do, which is your own self; when you unpack the details, your understanding applies to far fewer people than you imagine.

To use myself as a personal example, I choose to play video games because it’s objectively the most convenient way for me to unwind after a day or parental and professional duty, especially that I am a pretend extrovert who actually finds social occasions exhausting; I can just take two hours for myself, engage my mind fully on a game that I appreciate, and offset the stress that I accumulated during the day. 

Some video games _can_ be drugs _if_ the user is not careful in how they consume, but many video games offer an insightful, meaningful, and/or rewarding experience without the players becoming hooked: just because there are many commercial games that _can_ lead to addiction, it doesn’t mean all games can lead to addiction. To use a different analogy: just because there are people who drink & drive, or die of alcohol intoxication, and get involved in violence issues caused by alcohols, it doesn’t automatically make alcohols bad. 

(This is where I meant you took too many logical leaps, and I’d suggest [this reading list for you to go through](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/6s3xABaXKPdFwA3FS/what-is-evidence) to understand where you fell trap to your own biases.)

Don’t believe me? Go check out a game called GRIS: that game is a work of fine art, and I would be hard pressed to find someone that actually who enjoys it that also actually becomes addicted to it. I can pull out at least a dozen different examples here if you would like me to.",2020-07-29T14:34:26,/r/india/comments/hz9umz/modi_govt_wanted_to_ban_pubg_but_realised_youth/fzlim72/,rap43he,1e51c6f6-54f3-40c8-af64-949fae493dc6,1760185062526025730

Statues and temples come before education ,medical care , employment etc...

All the above make even  more sense when our own PM Modiji donot even take any press conference and the last time he took one the script was accidentally captured in the footage ( It doesn’t matter anyway because all they were asking was what he eats and how he gains his ATP in his muscles)

To make things worst the opposition seems dumbfounded. Instead of talking about demonetisation failure and GST affects they started propaganda as “chowkidar chor hain.”

“Neutral” itself doesn’t always mean not taking a side in general, it may only mean not taking a side at first and willingly hearing both sides of an argument before making a decision, thus keeping personal biases away from decision making as best as possible.


Neutrality itself may also mean not belonging to a political party, and making decisions based not on party choice but instead only on logic and morality.


In short, neutrality itself can simply mean to look at a topic without personal bias as best as possible.

hp2bgk,"BJP Blocks Parliament Panel Review Of PM CARES Fund, Coronavirus Response",2qh1q,t5_2qh1q,fxn848y,"Do they even need one? We are at a point in the history of the country where the majority of the population has bought in to a ultra-right wing group and allowed them to run the country. Who would they present the proof to? The opposition parties and people who have not bought into their narrative? Why? They are insignificant. They don't hold any power to bring the government to justice in any way, shape or form as long as the majority is happy with who they elected to \~govern\~ rule the country. The majority will buy into whatever narrative they spin and won't need any proof at all. Rest will demand proof but they can't do anything even if they themselves produce proof of fraud. The only institution that they could rely on (The Supreme Court) doesn't seem to be independent either anymore (looking back, was it ever?)

​

There are only two ways back from here to restoring whatever values (at least on paper) the country had. 

​

1. This government destroys the country to such an extent that people finally see them for what they are like the fascists in Italy, Spain and Germany or the communists in eastern Europe.
2. Somehow the opposition manages to bring the majority of the people around makes them see how they are being manipulated and their religious sentiments taken advantage of. How they've been turned into this insecure majority whose only purpose has become fighting the minorities and opposition instead of demanding healthcare, education, jobs and rights.   


There is a 3rd possibility as well. A future where the government actually manages to achieve some or most goals in improving people's lives. Where they manage raise the quality of life across the country and bring people out of poverty. Where cities become global economic power houses and rural regions flourish with agriculture, handicrafts and small industry. However, this requires an actual competent and educated government. A government that is comprised of scientists, thinkers and intellectuals, not one where priests and 8th grade pass-outs are allowed to run states and countries.   


In a way, we are fortunate that there aren't any actual intellectuals capable of actually make progress present in the government cause a competent government with fascist tendencies is far more dangerous than a foolish/uneducated/religious one in the long run \*but\* then again, I guess bigotry and religious fundamentalism tends to be inversely proportional to education and intellect. The more someone reads, learns and understand the world, the less bigoted and close-minded they \_tend\_ to become. Of course there are always exceptions but in general, people are either stupid/uneducated and subscribe to religious fundamentalism or educated/smart and more accepting of others, less hateful, believe in individual and societal liberties and rights.",2020-07-11T17:52:17,/r/india/comments/hp2bgk/bjp_blocks_parliament_panel_review_of_pm_cares/fxn848y/,hg03t,b90ac9a6-5e67-4ccd-97e8-fcad41bc6d07,1760186952749940736

> Sreeramulu is revered as Amarajeevi (""Immortal Being"") in the Andhra region for his self-sacrifice for the Andhra cause. He became famous for undertaking a hunger strike for 56 days in support of the formation of an Indian state for the Telugu-speaking population of Madras Presidency; he died in the process. His death sparked public rioting and Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru declared the intent by the newly liberated nation to form Andhra State three days following the death of Sreeramulu. He contributed his life for the formation of a separate Telugu-speaking state from the dominant Tamil-speaking state of Madras presidency (now Tamil Nadu). His struggles led to the formation of separate Telugu-speaking state called ""Andhra Pradesh"".

This is what [Rahul Gandhi said](https://twitter.com/RahulGandhi/status/1290910949755498498):

> *The world, and our own sub-continent's history and culture, bears the indelible imprint of Ramayana. The Indian psyche has always been inspired and encapsulated the spirit of Dharma, righteousness, duty, sacrifice, compassion, love, bravery and service, that runs through Ramayana - from north to south, from east to west, the 'Ramkatha' has manifested itself in immeasurable forms - just as the Lord has infinite incarnations, 'Ramkatha' has infinite forms.*

> *Ram is courage, Ram is unity, Ram is tolerance, Ram is fraternity. Ram belongs to everyone. Lord Ram is the good and well being of all. This is why Lord Ram is called 'Maryada Purshottam' (the epitome of principled conduct and righteousness).* 

> *Lord Ram symbolises sacrifice as also shelter. Ram belongs both to 'Sabri' as also to 'Sugriv'. Ram belong to 'Valmiki' as also to 'Bhasa'. Ram belongs to 'Kamban' as also to 'Ezhuthachan'. Ram belongs to 'Kabir', to 'Tulsidas' and to 'Raidas'. Ram personifies each one of us.*

> *Ram is an assimilation of all cultures, castes, class and religions and beyond any such barriers of language, regions or castes. Mahatma Gandhi's 'Raghupati Raghav Raja Ram' bestows divine wisdom and equanimity and Waris Ali Shah said, 'Rab is Ram'. Noted poet Maithali Sharan Gupt, described Ram as ""the strength of the oppressed and the voiceless"", while Mahapran Nirala described Lord Ram in his classical words as ""the power of eternal truth"".*

I didn't mean this in the context of religious beliefs of Congress leaders. I'll elaborate. Remember Varun Gandhi's hate speech in 2009? There was a huge uproar about that. Now, Varun Gandhi is not even a prominent figure in the BJP, maybe because he is not polarizing enough.

Terror accused like Pragya Singh Thakur are MPs and a hate monger is the CM of our most populous state and the de facto number 3 in BJP.

Stalin's purges, the Khmer Rouge, atrocities in North Korea - you can classify these all as Stalinism, Juche, Pol Pot-ism (is that a thing?) or whatever. That they happened in countries with atheist regimes is entirely incidental.

With the exception of Yugolsavia, the communist dictatorships such as Albania, the USSR and China (until the 1980s) did actively suppressed religion and promote athiesm though. I do agree it was motivated by a communist inspired athiesm of religion being a backward conservative force that oppresses the working-class. In the USSR this led to a terrorist group called the [League of Militant Athiests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/League_of_Militant_Atheists#Activities) who would go round killing clerics and religious followers, reducing the number of religious communities of all faiths from 50,000 in 1930 to 8,000 by 1941. Albania defined themselves the worlds first  'Athiest state' and banned religion and also mass murdered clerics and believers. Here they were explicitly defined themselves as atheist.

Is it because BJP was in the government in MH and they didn't want their lapdog to be arrested and put under investigation?",2020-11-05T21:58:50,/r/india/comments/jo171d/bjp_leaders_conveniently_kept_quiet_when_people/gb87gch/,5u7blp2d,e3d6502c-4b61-42a9-b0a7-15f52e0c5169,1760187618943827969

Systematic changes are required. I mean, I'm 17 and I cannot vote for another year, but those who did, what did they think? After GST, demonitization, communal violence, crashing the economy, people still thought I want more of this. Perhaps if it weren't for Balakot, BJP wouldn't had won or atleast wouldn't be this powerful.",2020-11-05T12:40:06,/r/india/comments/jo171d/bjp_leaders_conveniently_kept_quiet_when_people/gb745ax/,-1,4f09478a-4695-4c3e-87e2-ccc2bb2a2490,1760187618943827970

But the good thing about this Bihar election going on is that the opposition took up good and relevant issues against the ruling government. But then the BJP politicians came to give their speeches and started talking about hindutva, nationalism and China.
